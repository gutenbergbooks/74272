</div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is always delightful to read about Venice. This
city, so exceptionally situated, and to which belongs
so fascinating a history, has inspired almost countless
authors to extol its many beauties, to retell its
historic episodes, and to recount the treasures of its
art and architecture.</p>

<p>The praise of London is sung by the Londoner,
that of Paris by the Parisian, and so on, city by city.
But of the beauty of Venice members of every nation
have written, and perhaps in a greater measure than
the Venetians themselves. It is from these eulogies
that I have endeavoured to place before the reader
those prose passages and poems that paint in a few
words some of the varied charms belonging to Venice.</p>

is all the world knows. Motion that is almost imperceptible,
colour too deep and gorgeous to strike the eye, gilding so massive
and ancient as to wear a mist of amber brown upon its
brightness, white cupolas that time has turned to pearls,
marble that no longer looks like stone, but like blocks cut
from summer clouds, a smooth sea that is brighter and more
infinite than the sky it reflects—these are some of the ingredients
of the dream which are too familiar for description.
Nothing can describe the elemental warmth of the days, the
sea-kisses of the wind at evening, the atmosphere of breathless
tepid moonlight in the night.</p>

<h3>
SALVE VENETIA!<br>
</h3>
</div><!--end chapter header-->

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Venice</span> is the most personal of all cities in the world,
the most feminine, the most comparable to a woman,
the least dependent, for her individuality, upon her
inhabitants, ancient or modern. What would Rome
be without the memory of the Cæsars? What would
Paris be without the Parisians? What was Constantinople
like before it was Turkish? The imagination can
hardly picture a Venice different from her present self
at any time in her history. Where all is colour, the
more brilliant costumes of earlier times could add but
little; a general exodus of her inhabitants to-day
would leave almost as much of it behind. In the still
canals the gorgeous palaces continually gaze down
upon their own reflected images with placid satisfaction,
and look with calm indifference upon the changing
generations of men and women that glide upon the
waters. The mists gather upon the mysterious lagoons
and sink away again before the devouring light, day
after day, year after year, century after century; and
Venice is always there herself, sleeping or waking,
laughing, weeping, dreaming, singing or sighing, living
her own life through ages, with an intensely vital personality
which time has hardly modified, and is altogether
powerless to destroy. Somehow, it would not
surprise those who know her, to come suddenly upon
her and find that all human life was extinct within
her, while her own went on, strong as ever; nor yet,
in the other extreme, would it seem astonishing if all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
that has been should begin again, as though it had
never ceased to be, if the Bucentaur swept down the
Grand Canal to the beat of its two hundred oars, bearing
the Doge out to wed the sea with gorgeous train;
if the Great Council began to sit again in all its splendour;
if the Piazza were thronged once more with
men and women from the pictures of Paris Bordone,
Tintoretto, Paolo Veronese, and Titian; if Eastern
shipping crowded the entrance to the Giudecca, and
Eastern merchants filled the shady ways of the Merceria.
What miracle could seem miraculous in Venice,
the city of wonders?...</p>

<p>Venice was Venice from the first, and is Venice still,
a person in our imagination, almost more than a place....
‘Venice’ calls up a dream of colour, of rich
palaces and of still water, and at the name there are
more men who will think of Shylock and Othello than
of Enrico Dandolo, or Titian, or Carlo Zeno, or Vittor
Pisani....</p>

<p>Who seeks true poetry, said Rossi, writing on Venice,
will find it most abundantly in the early memories of
a Christian nation; and indeed the old chronicles are
full of it, of idyls, of legends, and of heroic tales.
Only dream a while over the yellow pages of Muratori,
and presently you will scent the spring flowers of a
thousand years ago, and hear the ripple of the blue
waves that lent young Venice their purity, their brilliancy,
and their fresh young music. You may even
enjoy a pagan vision of maiden Aphrodite rising suddenly
out of the sea into the sunshine, but the dream
dissolves only too soon; grace turns into strength,
the lovely smile of the girl-goddess fades from the
commanding features of the reigning queen, and
heavenly Venus is already earthly Cleopatra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
It is better to open our arms gladly to the beautiful
when she comes to us, than to prepare our dissecting
instruments as soon as we are aware of her presence....
And so with Venice; she is a form of beauty, and
must be looked upon as that and nothing else; not
critically, for criticism means comparison, and Venice
is too personal and individual, and too unlike other
cities to be fairly compared with them; not coldly,
for she appeals to the senses and to the human heart,
and craves a little warmth of sympathy; above all,
not in a spirit of righteous severity, for he who would
follow her story must learn to forgive her almost at
every step.</p>

<p>She has paid for her mistakes with all save her inextinguishable
life; she has expiated her sins of ill-faith,
of injustice and ingratitude, by the loss of everything
but her imperishable charm.</p>

<a id="p_7"></a>VENICE THE ENCHANTRESS<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Venice</span> has long borne in the imagination of the world
a distinctive position, something of the character of a
great enchantress, a magician of the seas. Her growth
between the water and the sky; her great palaces,
solid and splendid, built, so to speak, on nothing; the
wonderful glory of light and reflection about her; the
glimmer of incessant brightness and movement; the
absence of all those harsh, artificial sounds which vex
the air in other towns, but which in her are replaced
by harmonies of human voices, and by the liquid
tinkle of the waves—all these unusual characteristics
combine to make her a wonder and a prodigy. While
there are scarcely any who are unmoved by her special
charm, there are some who are entirely subdued by it,
to whom the sight of her is a continual enchantment,
and who never get beyond the sense of something
miraculous, the rapture of the first vision. Not only
does she ‘shine where she stands,’ which even the
poorest cluster of human habitations will do in the
light of love: but all those walls, with the mist of ages
like a bloom of eternal youth upon them—all those
delicate pinnacles and carven-stones, the arches and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the pillars and the balconies, the fretted outlines that
strike against the sky—shine too as with a light
within that radiates into the clear sea-air; and every
ripple on the great water-way, and every wave on the
lagoon, and each little rivulet of a canal, like a line of
light between the piles of masonry, which are themselves
built of pearl and tints of ocean shells, shines
too with an ever-varied, fantastic, enchanting glimmer
of responsive brightness. In the light of summer
mornings, in the glow of winter sunsets, Venice stands
out upon the blue background, the sea that brims
upwards to her very doors, the sky that sweeps in
widening circles all around, radiant with an answering
tone of light. She is all wonder, enchantment, the
brightness and the glory of a dream. Her own children
cannot enough paint her, praise her, celebrate her
splendours; and to outdo if possible that patriotic
enthusiasm has been the effort of many a stranger
from afar....</p>

<p>Where is the poet, where the prophet, the princes,
the scholars, the men whom, could we see, we should
recognize wherever we met them, with whom the
whole world is acquainted? They are not here. In
the sunshine of the Piazza, in the glorious gloom of
San Marco, in the great council-chambers and offices
of State, once so full of busy statesmen, and great
interests, there is scarcely a figure recognizable of all,
to be met with in spirit—no one whom we look for as
we walk, whose individual footsteps are traceable
wherever we turn. Instead of the men who made her
what she is, who ruled her with so high a hand, who
filled her archives with the most detailed narratives,
and gleaned throughout the world every particular of
universal history which could enlighten and guide her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
we find everywhere the great image—an idealisation
more wonderful than any in poetry—of Venice herself,
the crowned and reigning city, the centre of all their
aspirations, the mistress of their affections, for whom
those haughty patricians of an older day, with a proud
self-abnegation which has no humility or sacrifice in
it, effaced themselves, thinking of nothing but her
glory....</p>

<p>Though there is no record of that time when Dante
stood within the red walls of the arsenal, and saw the
galleys making and mending, and the pitch fuming up
to heaven—as all the world may still see them through
his eyes—yet a milder scholarly image, a round smooth
face, with cowl and garland, looks down upon us from
the gallery, all blazing with crimson and gold, between
the horses of San Marco, a friendly visitor, the best
we could have, since Dante left no sign behind him,
and probably was never heard of by the magnificent
Signoria. Petrarch stands there, to be seen by the side
of the historian-doge, as long as Venice lasts: but not
much of him, only a glimpse, as in the Venetian way,
lest in contemplation of the poet we should for a
moment forget the Republic, his hostess and protector—Venice,
the all-glorious mistress of the seas,
the first object, the unrivalled sovereign of her
children’s thoughts and hearts.</p>

<a id="p_10"></a>VENETIAN ENCHANTMENT<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Can</span> you fancy a city without a horse in it, or a carriage,
where not even a van or a truck disturbs the
stillness, where your household possessions are moved
on the witching first of May in boats, and you drift
along in a gondola to your merry-makings or your
funerals? Such a city is Venice, where, as Browning
wrote, ‘the sea the street is.’ I went out of the railroad-station
into a gondola, and the enchantment
began. I felt the spell, at once, of this unique city,—this
one only Venice in all the world. Everywhere
were gondolas,—gondolas moored at the quay, waiting
for passengers; gondolas drawn up in front of palaces,
waiting for their freight of dark-eyed Venetian girls;
gondolas threading the mazes of the little canals, or
sweeping down the Grand Canal, and drawing near
each other now and then for a chat between the
occupants.</p>

<p>All these gondolas are painted black. This is in
accordance with an ancient law of the Republic,
passed once upon a time when the decorations of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
fascinating water-carriages were becoming too sumptuous
for Republican morals. But even now many of
the gondolas are very elegant. They are long and
slender in shape, with a high beak pointed with steel;
they are often superb in carving. Inside the little
house in which you sit are soft cushions, and gilt-framed
mirrors in which the piquant, dark-eyed faces
of the Italian girls behold themselves in fascinating
reflection....</p>

<p>Venice is a city of palaces. Three-quarters of them
are unoccupied now, save by the stranger within her
gates, who hires them for a season. But they are
wonderfully beautiful, with their superb architecture
and their great variety of colouring. Nothing could
be more delightful than a sail down the Grand Canal
at sunset, unless it be one by moonlight.</p>

<p>At sunset, after the warmest day, the air is cool.
The sky is crimson above you, and the water which
laps around your black keel is crimson also. Everybody
has come out to enjoy the delicious coolness and
shadow. You meet your friends, and exchange greetings
with them as you would in the Casino at Florence
or the Central Park in New York. The old palaces
catch the sunset glory, and glow in it with a splendour
as radiant as their memories. Busy waiters are arranging
the out-of-door tables in front of the cafés in the
grand piazza of San Marco for their evening custom.
You drift on and on, till the sunset glory fades, and a
new glory, purer and paler, has arisen,—the glory of
the moon.</p>

<p>Everybody raves about moonlight in Venice, and
well they may, for there is nothing on earth so enchanting.
You forget the far-off world,—that old,
hard world, where waggons rattle, and horses stumble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
and fall, and people are tired, and duns harass you,
and time and tide wait for no man. In this enchanted
Venice, it seems to you, no one is ever sad, or cross,
or weary. You think that here, at least, you could be
reconciled to an earthly immortality. The feeling is
universal. A rich Englishman, while I was there,
leased one of the old palaces for twenty-five years to
come, and was busily adorning it with gems of art.
He put into it old Venetian glasses, strange mirrors
with nymphs and roses painted on them, such as were
the glory of Venice long ago. His silver was wrought
by the men of Benvenuto Cellini’s time. In his hall
were marble statues sculptured by long-forgotten
hands. His chairs and tables were carved by cunning
workmen who had turned to dust. Everything was of
the past, except the flowers, which everywhere ran
riot. Marble vases, rifled from tombs, were full of
glowing crimson roses. Bright-hued blossoms filled
the windows, vines trailed over the walls, fragrance
as of a thousand gardens flooded the rooms.</p>

<p>‘Twenty-five years!’ cried a friend, who was looking
on at the lavish adornment of the old palace.
‘Are you sure you will be contented here so long?’</p>

<p>‘If not, it is hopeless,’ was the answer, ‘for I’ve
tried the rest of the world, and found it wanting.
Year after year Venice has drawn me back again with
her charm, always new, though so old. If <em>she</em> fails to
content me, there is nothing left but to go to heaven.’</p>

<p>And there are those who think, having reached
Venice, that they have gone very nigh to heaven. At
least, let us fancy it is that Island of the Blest which
the old voyageurs used to seek....</p>

<p>There are few places more prolific of temptations
to the purse than this city by the sea. You could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
spend a small fortune in photographs; and no photographs
are so beautiful as those of Venice, with her
water-ways, her sumptuous architecture, and her picturesque
gondolas. You go a few steps from the
photographer’s, and pause before the window of a
shop for the sale of antiquities. If you have any
imagination at all, you are fascinated at once. You
find here quaint rings, as old as the days of the Doges;
lace which generations of by-gone marquises have
worn, and which time has turned to the hue of amber;
fans behind which the dear, dead women, with their
red-gold hair that Titian painted, blushed and bloomed
and sighed and flirted. Here are shoe-buckles glittering
with diamonds; here, in short, are a thousand
relics of a beauty-loving and luxurious past; and you
cannot turn away from them until you have bought
something by way of talisman, wherewith to conjure
back the shades of dead days and faded glories.</p>

<p>You see long lines of shops, full of the Venetian
mosaic, and of the Venetian gold-work, which is the
daintiest that you can imagine. Here is Salviati’s
priceless glass. It is Salviati who has rediscovered the
secrets of the old glass-makers. He will tell you that
there can be no such thing as a lost art, while the
human brain retains its former power; and in this
matter of glass-making, at least, he has proved his
own theories. Such wonderful colours, such wonderful
shapes, such exquisite designs, can be found nowhere
else. It almost converts one to Spiritualism, this exceptional
success of Salviati’s, and makes you think
that the ghosts of some of the old glass-makers have
been whispering their long-forgotten secrets into his
ears. You have fingered all the morning round this
captivating piazza of San Marco, with its shops full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
of temptations, and now the bronze Vulcans of the
clock-tower march out and strike the hour of two,
and retire again; and just as they beat their retreat
you see one of the prettiest sights in Venice. Long
ago—at the beginning of the thirteenth century, so
the story runs,—Admiral Dandolo, while besieging
Candia, received intelligence by means of carrier-pigeons
which greatly aided him. He then sent the
birds to Venice with the news of his success; and
since that period their descendants have been carefully
cherished and greatly prized by the Venetians.
Every day, at two o’clock the doves are fed at the
expense of the city.... Venice! You can pass your
dreamy days there in the luxury of an absolute repose.
No other place is like it for beauty, and certainly no
other is like it for restfulness.... Gay belles, who
have tired themselves out by a busy winter in Rome
or Florence, betake themselves to this City of the Sea,
and win back their roses in its quiet. Its spell is on
you from the first moment you arrive. It seems to
me no one could ever leave it willingly; and if only
the post could be abolished, and no letters would
come to call you back to the world outside, you might
stay there for ever without knowing it,—like the
monk who laid his ear so close to heaven that he
heard in his dream the songs of Paradise, and awoke
to find that he had been listening to them for a
thousand years.</p>

<a id="p_17"></a>SPECTRAL VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent">‘<span class="smcap">I know</span> another sight,’ said the Moon, ‘the spectre
of a city. Whenever the jetty fountains splash into
the marble basins, they seem to me to be telling the
story of the floating city. Yes, the spouting water
may tell of her, the waves of the sea may sing of her
fame! On the surface of the ocean a mist often rests,
and this is her widow’s veil. The Bridegroom of the
Sea is dead; his palace and his city are his mausoleum.
Dost thou know this city? She has never heard the
rolling of wheels or the hoof-tread of horses in her
streets, through which the fish swim, while the black
gondola glides spectrally over the green water. I will
show you the place,’ continued the Moon, ‘the largest
square in it, and you will fancy yourself transported
into the city of a fairy-tale. The grass grows rank
among the broad flag-stones, and in the morning twilight
thousands of tame pigeons flutter around the
solitary lofty tower. On three sides you find yourself
surrounded by cloistered walks. In these the silent
Turk sits smoking his long pipe; the handsome Greek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
leans against the pillar, and gazes at the upraised
trophies and lofty masts, memorials of power that is
gone. The flags hang down like mourning scarves. A
girl rests there; she has put down her heavy pails
filled with water, the yoke with which she has carried
them rests on one of her shoulders, and she leans
against the mast of victory. This is not a fairy-palace
you see before you yonder, but a church; the gilded
domes and shining orbs flash back my beams; the
glorious bronze horses up yonder have made journeys,
like the bronze horse in the fairy-tale; they have
come hither, and gone hence, and have returned again.
Do you notice the variegated splendour of the walls
and windows? It looks as if Genius had followed the
caprices of a child, in the adornment of these singular
temples. Do you see the winged lion on the pillar?
The gold glitters still, but his wings are tied; the lion
is dead, for the King of the Sea is dead; the great
halls stand desolate, and where gorgeous painting
hung of yore, the naked wall now peers through. The
<i lang="it">lazzaroni</i> sleeps under the arcade, whose pavement in
old times was to be trodden only by the feet of the
high nobility. From the deep wells, and perhaps from
the prisons by the Bridge of Sighs, rise the accents of
woe, as at the time when the mandolino was heard
in gay gondolas, and the golden ring was cast from
the Bucentaur to Adria, the Queen of the Seas.
Adria! shroud thyself in mists; let the veil of thy
widowhood shroud thy form, and clothe in the weeds
of woe the mausoleum of thy bridegroom—the marble,
spectral Venice!’</p>

    <div class="verse indent2"><span class="smcap">I stood</span> in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A palace and a prison on each hand:</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Poured in her lap all gems in sparkling showers.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In purple was she robed, and of her feast</div>

IN PRAISE OF VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Though</span> the incomparable and most decantated
majestie of this citie doth deserve a farre more elegant
and curious pensill to paint her out in her colours then
mine. For I ingenuously confess mine owne insufficiency
and unworthiness, as being the unworthiest
of ten thousand to describe so beautiful, so renowned,
so glorious a Virgin (for by that title doth the world
most deservedly stile her), because my rude and unpolished
pen may rather staine and eclipse the resplendent
rays of her unparalleled beauty, then adde any
lustre unto it; yet since I have hitherto contrived this
slender and naked narration of my observations of five
moneths travels in forraine countries, this noble citie
doth in a manner chalenge this at my hands, that I
should describe her also as well as the other cities I
saw in my journey, partly because shee gave me most
loving and kinde entertainment for the space of sixe
weeks, which was the sweetest time (I must needes
confesse) for so much that ever I spent in my life; and
partly for that she ministered unto me more variety of
remarkable and delicious objects then mine eyes ever
survayed in any citie before, or ever shall, if I should
with famous Sir John Mandevil our English Ulysses
spend thirty whole yeares together in travelling over
most places of the Christian and Ethnicke world.
Therefore omitting tedious introductions, I will
descend to the description of this thrise worthie citie:
the fairest Lady, yea the richest Paragon and Queene
of Christendome. (I call her not thus in respect of any
soveraignty that she hath over other nations, in which
sense Rome was in former times called Queene of the
world, but in regard of her incomparable situation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
surpassing wealth, and most magnificent buildings.)
Such is the rareness of the situation of Venice, that it
doth even amaze and drive into admiration all strangers
that upon their first arrivall behold the same.
For it is built altogether upon the water in the innermost
gulfe of the Adriatique Sea which is commonly
called Gulfo di Venetia, and is distant from the maine
sea about the space of three miles.... The city is
divided in the middest by a goodly faire channel,
which they call Canal il Grande. The same is crooked,
and made in the form of a Roman S. It is in length a
thousand and three hundred paces, and in breadth at
least forty, in some places more. The sixe parts of the
City whereof Venice consisteth, are situate on both
sides of this Canal il Grande. The names of them are
these, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marco, Castello, Canareio, that lie on one
side of it, and those on the other side are called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Polo, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croce, Dorso Duro. Also both sides of this
channel are adorned with many sumptuous and magnificent
Palaces that stand very neare to the water, and
make a very glorious and beautifull shew. For many
of them are of a great height, three or foure stories
high, most being built with bricke, and some few with
faire free stone. Besides, they are adorned with a
great multitude of stately pillars made partly of white
stone, and partly of Istrian marble.... There is only
one bridge to go over the great channell, which is the
same that leadeth from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marks to the Rialto, and
joyneth together both the banks of the channell. This
bridge is commonly called Ponte de Rialto, and is the
fairest bridge by many degrees for one arch that ever
I saw, read, or heard of. For it is reported that it cost
about fourescore thousand crownes, which doe make
foure and twenty thousand pounds sterling. Truely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the exact view hereof ministered unto me no small
matter of admiration to see a bridge of that length (for
it is two hundred foote long, the channell being at the
least forty paces broade as I have before written) so
curiously compacted together with only one arch; and
it made me presently call to minde that most famous
bridge of the Emperour Trajan, so celebrated by the
auncient historians, especially that worthy Greeke
Authour Dion Cassius, which he built over the river
Danubius, to enter the country of Dacia.... But this
incomparable one-arched bridge of the Rialto doth
farre excell the fairest arch of Trajans both in length
and breadth. For this is both forty foote longer than
the arch of his bridge was, and a hundred foote
brooder, as I will anon declare in the more particular
description thereof. But in height I believe it is a
little inferiour to the other. I will proceede with the
description of this peereless bridge of Venice. It was
first built but with timber (as I heard divers Venetian
gentlemen report), but because that was not correspondent
to the magnificence of the other parts of the City,
they defaced that, and built this most sumptuous
bridge with squared white stone, having two faire
rowes of pretty little houses for artificers, which are
only shops, not dwelling houses. Of these shops there
are two rowes in each side of the bridge till you come
to the toppe. On that side of this bridge which is
towards <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marks, there are ten severall ascents of
staires to the toppe, on the other side towards the
Rialto twelve ascents. Likewise, behind these shops
there are very faire staires to the toppe, which doe
reach in length from the back of them to the farthest
edge of the bridge.... At the toppe of the bridge
directly above these rowes of buildings that I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
spoken of, wherein the artificers shops are, there are
advanced two faire arches to a prety convenient height
which doe greatly adorne the bridge. In these arches
I saw the portraiture of the heads of two Hunnicall
Gyants that came into Italy with King Attila, very
exactly made in the inside of the toppe. There are in
Venice thirteen ferries or passages, which they commonly
call Traghetti, where passengers may be transported
in a Gondola to what place of the City they
will.... Certaine little boates which they call Gondolas
[are] the fayrest that ever I saw in any place.
For none of them are open above, but fairly covered,
first with some fifteene or sixteen little round peeces
of timber that reach from one end to the other, and
make a pretty kinde of Arch or vault in the Gondola;
then with faire blacke cloth which is turned up at
both ends of the boate, to the end that if the passenger
meaneth to be private, he may draw downe the same,
and after row so secretly that no man can see him: in
the inside the benches are finely covered with blacke
leather, and the bottomes of many of them together
with the sides under the benches are very neatly
garnished with fine linnen cloth, the edge whereof is
laced with bonelace: the ends are beautified with two
pretty and ingenious devices. For each end hath a
crooked thing made in the forme of a Dolphins tayle,
with the fins very artifically represented, and it
seemeth to be tinned over. The water-men that row
these never sit as ours do in London, but alwaies
stand, and that at the further end of the Gondola,
sometimes one, but most commonly two; and in my
opinion they are altogether as swift as our rowers
about London.... The fairest place of all the citie
(which is indeed of that admirable and incomparable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
beauty, that I thinke no place whatsoever eyther in
Christendome or Paganisme may compare with it) is
the Piazza, that is, the Market place of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marke, or
(as our English merchants commorant in Venice, doe
call it) the place of S. Marke, in Latin Forum, or
Platea Di Marci. Truely such is the stupendious (to
use a strange Epitheton for so strange and rare a place
as this) glory of it, that at my first entrance thereof
it did even amaze or rather ravish my senses. For here
is the greatest magnificence of architecture to be
seene, that any place under the sunne doth yeelde.
Here you may both see all manner of fashions of attire,
and heare all the languages of Christendome, besides
those that are spoken by the barbarous Ethnickes;
the frequencie of people being so great twise a day,
betwixt sixe of the clocke in the morning and eleven,
and againe betwixt five in the afternoon and eight,
that (as an elegant writer saith of it) a man may very
properly call it rather Orbis then Urbis forum, that is,
a market place of the world, not of the citie.... But
I will descend to the particular description of this
peerelesse place, wherein if I seeme too tedious, I
crave pardon of thee (gentle Reader) seeing the variety
of curious objects which it exhibiteth to the spectator
is such, that a man shall much wrong it to speake a
little of it. The like tediousenesse thou art like to
finde also in my description of the Duke’s Palace, and
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Markes Church, which are such glorious workes,
that I endeavoured to observe as much of them as I
might, because I knew it was uncertaine whether I
should ever see them againe, though I hoped for it.
This street of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marke seemeth to be but one, but if
the beholder doth exactly view it, he will finde that
it containeth foure distinct and severall streetes in it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
which I will thus divide: The first is that which reacheth
from the front of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Markes Church to the opposite
front of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Geminians Church. The second from that
notable clocke at the cumming into <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Markes from
the Merceria to the two lofty marble pillars neare to
the shore of the Adriatique Gulfe. These two streetes
doe seeme to contend for the superiority, but the
first (in my opinion) is the fairest of them. The third
reacheth from the bridge neare to the prison, along by
the South side of the Dukes Palace, and so by the
Sea shore, to the end of that stately building a little
beyond the foresaid pillars. The fourth and the last
from one side of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Markes Church to the Canons
houses. The first of these is beyond all comparison
the fairest of all Europe. For it hath two such magnificent
fronts or rowes of buildings on the North and
South sides opposite each other, especially that on
the North side, that they drove me into great admiration,
and so I thinke they doe all other strangers that
behold the same.... The fairest streete of all Venice
saving Sainte Markes, which I have already described,
is that adjoyning to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Markes place which is called
the Merceria, which name it hath because many
Mercers dwell there, as also many Stationers, and
sundry other artificers. This streete reacheth from
almost the hither side of the Rialto bridge to Saint
Markes, being of goodly length, but not altogether
of the broadest, yet of breadth convenient enough in
some places for five or sixe persons to walke together
side by side; it is paved with bricke, and adorned with
many faire buildings of a competent height on both
sides; there is a very faire gate at one end of this street
even as you enter into <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Markes place when you
come from the Rialto bridge, which is decked with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
great deale of faire marble, in which gate are two
pretty conceits to be observed, the one at the very
top, which is a clocke with the images of two wilde
men by it made in brasse, a witty device and very
exactly done.... The other conceit that is to be observed
in this gate is the picture of the Virgin Mary
made in a certaine dore above a faire Dial, neare to
whom on both sides of her are painted two Angels on
two little dores more. These dores upon any principall
holiday doe open themselves, and immediately there
come forth two Kings to present themselves to our
Lady, unto whom, after they have done their obeysance
by uncovering of their heads, they returne, againe
into their places: in the front of this sumptuous
gate are presented the twelve celestial signes, with
the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, most excellently
handled.</p>

THE FAIRY DAYS OF VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> absence of horses and carriages and the resonance
of the canal make Venice the most delightful city for
unceasing songs and serenading. One must be an enthusiast
indeed to fancy that the gondolier choruses are
better than those of the opera at Paris, as I have heard
asserted by some individuals of a particularly happy
temperament, but it is quite certain that one of those
choruses, heard from afar under the arcades of these
Moorish palaces, looking so white in the moon’s rays,
gives more pleasure even than better music executed
under a colonnade formed of painted canvas. These
rough uncultivated dilettanti shout in tune and time;
and the calm marble echoes prolong these rude and
grave harmonies, like the winds over the sea. The
magic of acoustic effect, and the desire to hear some
sort of harmony in the silence of these enchanted
nights, make one listen with indulgence, and almost
I may say with gratitude, to the humblest melody
which floats by, and is lost in the distance....
Fairy days of Venice.... No one has ever said
enough of the beauty of the heavens, and the delights
of the night at Venice. The lagoon is so calm, that in
fine evenings, the stars do not even tremble on its
surface. When you are in the midst, it is so blue, so
quiet that the outline of the horizon cannot be distinguished,
and the waves and the heavens form an
azure veil, where reverie loses itself and sleeps. The
atmosphere is so transparent, so pure that thousands
more stars may be seen, than in our North of France.
I have seen here, nights, when the silvery lustre of
the stars occupied more space in the firmament than
the blue of the atmosphere. It was a galaxy of diamonds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
giving almost as good a light as the moon at
Paris.... Here Nature, more powerful in her influence,
perhaps, imposes too much silence on the mind;
she sends all thought to sleep, but agitates the heart,
and dominates the senses. One must not even dream,
unless one is a man of genius, of writing poems during
these voluptuous nights: one must love or sleep.</p>

<p>As for sleeping, there is a most delicious spot: the
platform of white marble which descends from the
Viceroy’s gardens to the canal. When the ornamented
gate is shut on the garden-side, one can go in a gondola
to these steps, still warm from the rays of the setting
sun, and remain without being interrupted by any
inopportune stroller, unless he be endowed with the
faith so much needed by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter. Many hours have
I passed there alone, thinking of nothing, whilst
Catullo and his gondola slumbered in the midst of the
waters, within call.</p>

<p>When the breath of midnight passes over the linden-trees,
and scatters their blossoms over the waters,
when the perfume of wallflowers and geraniums rises
in gusts, as though the earth gave forth her sighs of
fragrance to the moon; when the cupolas of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary
raise towards heaven their alabaster hemispheres and
their turban-crowned minarets; when all is white, the
water, the sky, the marble, the three elements of
Venice, and when from the tower of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark a giant
sound hovers over my head, then I begin to feel life
through every pore, and evil be to him who should
then come to make an appeal to my soul! I vegetate,
I repose, I forget. Who would not do the same in my
place?... I defy anyone, no matter who, to prevent
me from sleeping happily when I see Venice, so impoverished,
so oppressed, so miserable, still so beautiful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
so calm, in spite of men and of time. Behold her,
round me, admiring herself in the lagoons with the
air of a sultana; and this populace of fishermen,
sleeping on the pavement, winter as well as summer,
with no other pillow than one of granite, no other
mattress than a tattered cloak; is not such a populace
a great example of philosophy? When it has no
longer wherewithal to purchase a pound of rice, it
sings a chorus to drive away the pangs of hunger;
thus braving masters and misery, as it used to brave
cold, heat, and the sudden tempest. It would require
many years of slavery to imbrute entirely this careless
frivolous character, so accustomed for many years
to be nourished with <i lang="fr">fêtes</i> and diversions. Existence
is still so easy at Venice!</p>

always so content there, though.’ It is really just so
one lives at this lovely Venice. One has heard of a
horse being exhibited there, and yesterday I watched
the poor people paying a penny a-piece for the sight
of a stuffed one.... The view of Venice from the
Zuecca would invite one never more to stray from it,
farther, at least, than to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Church, on
another little opposite island, whence the prospect is
surely wonderful.... On Saturday next I am to

<p>These wishes come to you from Venice, a place
where there is nothing wanting that heart can wish;
renowned Venice, the admiredst city in the world, a
city that all Europe is bound unto, for she is her
greatest rampart against that huge eastern tyrant the
Turk by sea, else I believe he had overrun all Christendom
by this time. Against him this city hath performed
notable exploits, and not only against him,
but divers other. She hath restored emperors to their
throne, and popes to their chairs, and with her galleys
often preserved Saint Peter’s barque from sinking:
for which, by way of reward, one of his successors
espoused her to the sea, which marriage is solemnly
renewed every year in solemn profession by the Doge
and all the Clarissimos, and a gold ring cast into the
sea out of the great galleasse, called the <dfn>Bucentoro</dfn>,
wherein the first ceremony was performed by the Pope
himself, above three hundred years since, and they
say it is the self-same vessel still, though often put
upon the careen and trimmed. This made me think on
that famous ship at Athens; nay, I fell upon an abstracted
notion in philosophy, and a speculation touching
the body of man, which being in perpetual flux,
and a kind of succession of decays, and consequently
requiring ever and anon a restoration of what it loseth
of the virtue of the former ailment, and what was converted
after the third concoction into blood and fleshly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
substance, which, as in all other sublunary bodies that
have internal principles of heart, uses to transpire,
breathe out, and waste away through invisible pores
by exercise, motion, and sleep to make room still for
a supply of new nourriture. I fell, I say, to consider
whether our bodies may be said to be of like condition
with this <i lang="it">Bucentoro</i>, which, though it be reputed still
the same vessel, yet I believe there’s not a foot of that
timber remaining which it had upon the first dock,
having been, as they tell me, so often planked and
ribbed, caulked and pierced. In like manner our bodies
may be said to be daily repaired by new sustenance,
which begets new blood, and consequently new spirits,
new humours, and I may say new flesh, the old by
continual deperdition and insensible transpirations
evaporating still out of us, and giving way to stress;
so that I make a question, whether by reason of these
perpetual preparations and accretions the body of
man may be said to be the same numerical body in
his old age that he had in his manhood, or the same in
his manhood that he had in his youth, the same in his
youth that he carried about him in his childhood, or
the same in his childhood which he wore first in the
womb. I make a doubt whether I had the same
identical individually numerical body when I carried
a calf-leather satchel to school in Hereford, as when I
wore a lambskin hood in Oxford, or whether I have
the same mass of blood in my veins, and the same
flesh now in Venice which I carried about me three
years since up and down London streets, having in
lieu of beer and ale drunk wine all this while, and fed
upon different viands; now the stomach is like a
crucible, for it hath a chemical kind of virtue to
transmute one body into another, to transubstantiate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
fish and fruits into flesh within, and about us; but
though it be questionable whether I wear the same
flesh which is fluxible, I am sure my hair is not the
same, for you may remember I went flaxen-haired
out of England, but you shall find me returned with a
very dark brown, which I impute not only to the heat
and air of those hot countries I have ate my bread in,
but to the quality and difference of food; but you
will say that hair is but an excrementitious thing, and
makes not to this purpose; moreover, methinks I hear
you say that this may be true, only in the blood and
spirits, or such fluid parts, not in the solid and heterogeneal
parts; but I will press no further at this time
this philosophical notion which the sight of <i lang="it">Bucentoro</i>
infused into me, for it hath already made me exceed
the bounds of a letter, and I fear me to trespass too
much upon your patience. I leave the further disquisition
of this point to your own contemplations,
who are a far riper philosopher than I, and have waded
deeper into, and drunk more of Aristotle’s Well; but
... though it be doubtful whether I carry about
me the same body or no, in all points that I had
in England, I am well assured I bear still the same
mind, and therein I verify the old <span class="lock">verse—</span></p>

and gentry fled into these lakes and little islands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
amongst the fishermen for their security, and finding
the air good and commodious for habitation, they
began to build upon those small islands, whereof there
are in all three-score; and in tract of time, they conjoined
and leagued them together by bridges, whereof
there are now above eight hundred, and this makes
up the city of Venice, who is now above twelve ages
old, and was contemporary with the monarchy of
France; but the signiory glorieth in one thing above
the monarchy, that she was born a Christian, but the
monarchy not. Though this city be thus hemmed in
with the sea, yet she spreads her wings far wide upon
the shore; she hath in Lombardy six considerable
towns—Padua, Verona, Vicenza, Brescia, Crema, and
Bergamo; she hath in the Marquisat, Bassan and
Castlefranco; she hath all Friuli and Istria; she commands
the shores of Dalmatia and Slavonia; she keeps
under the power of Saint Mark, the islands of Corfu
(anciently Corcyria), Cephalonia, Zant, Cerigo, Lucerigo,
and Candy (Jove’s Cradle); she had a long time
the kingdom of Cyprus, but it was quite rent from her
by the Turk, which made that high-spirited Bassa,
being taken prisoner at the Battle of Lepanto, where
the grand signior lost above 200 galleys, to say, ‘That
that defeat to his great master was but like the shaving
of his beard or the paring of his nails; but the taking
of Cyprus was like the cutting off of a limb, which will
never grow again.’ This mighty potentate being so
near a neighbour to her, she is forced to comply with
him and give him an annual present in gold: she hath
about thirty galleys most part of the year in course
to scour and secure the gulf; she entertains by land in
Lombardy and other parts 25,000 foot, besides some
of the cantons of Suisses whom she gives pay unto;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
she hath also in constant pay 600 men of arms, and
every one of these must keep two horses a-piece, for
which they are allowed 120 ducats a year, and they
are for the most part gentlemen of Lombardy. When
they have any great expedition to make, they have
always a stranger for their general, but he is supervised
by two proveditors, without whom he cannot
attempt anything.</p>

<p>Her great Council consists of above 2,000 gentlemen,
and some of them meet every Sunday and holiday to
choose officers and magistrates, and every gentleman
being past twenty-five years of age is capable to sit in
this Council. The Doge or Duke (their sovereign
magistrate) is chosen by lots, which would be too
tedious here to demonstrate, and commonly he is an
aged man who is created, like that course they hold
in the popedom. When he is dead there be inquisitors
that examine his actions, and his misdemeanours are
punishable in his heirs. There is a superintendent
council of ten, and six of them may dispatch business
without the Doge, but the Doge never without some of
them, not as much as open a letter from any foreign
state, though addressed to himself, which makes him to
be called by other princes, <dfn lang="it">Testa di legno</dfn>, a head of wood.</p>

<p>The wealth of this republic hath been at a stand, or
rather declining, since the Portugal found a road to
the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope; for this
city was used to fetch all those spices and other Indian
commodities from the grand Cairo down the Nile,
being formerly carried to Cairo from the Red Sea upon
camels’ and dromedaries’ backs, three score days’
journey; and so Venice used to dispense those commodities
through all Christendom, which not only the
Portugal, but the English and Hollander, now transport,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
and are masters of the trade. Yet there is no
outward appearance at all of poverty, or any decay in
this city, but she is still gay, flourishing, and fresh,
and flowing with all kind of bravery and delight, which
may be had at cheap rates....</p>

<p>I have now enough of the maiden city, and this
week I am to go further into Italy; for though I have
been a good while in Venice, yet I cannot say I have
been hitherto upon the continent of Italy: for this
city is nought else but a knot of islands in the Adriatic
Sea, joined in one body by bridges, and a good way
distant from the firm land. I have lighted upon very
choice company, your cousin Brown and Master Web,
and we all take the road of Lombardy, but we made
an order amongst ourselves that our discourse be
always in the language of the country, under penalty
of a forfeiture, which is to be indispensably paid.
Randal Symns made us a curious feast lately, where
in a cup of the richest Greek we had your health, and
I could not tell whether the wine or the remembrance
of you was sweeter; for it was naturally a kind of
aromatic wine, which left a fragrant perfuming kind
of farewell behind it. I have sent you a runlet of it in
the ship <i>Lion</i>, and if it come safe, and unpricked, I
pray bestow some bottles upon the lady (you know)
with my humble service.... Before I conclude I will
acquaint you with a common saying that is used of
this dainty city of Venice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry small" lang="it">
    <div class="verse indent0a">‘Venetia, Venetia, chi non te vede non te pregia,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ma chi t’ha troppo veduto te dispreggia.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Englished and rhymed thus (though I know you need
no translation, you understand so much of Italian):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry small">
    <div class="verse indent0a">‘Venice, Venice, none thee unseen can prize,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who hath seen too much will thee despise.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
I will conclude with that famous hexastic which
Sannazaro made of this rare city, which pleaseth me
much better:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry small">
    <div class="verse indent0a" lang="la">‘Viderat Hadriacis Venetam Neptunus in undis</div>
    <div class="verse indent2" lang="la">Stare urbem, et toti ponere jura Mari;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0" lang="la">Nunc mihi Tarpeias quantum vis, Jupiter, Arces</div>
    <div class="verse indent2" lang="la">Objice, et illa tui mænia Martis ait,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0" lang="la">Sic Pelago Tibrim præfers, urbem aspice utramque,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2" lang="la">Illam homines dices, hanc posuisse Deos.’</div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0a">‘When Neptune saw in Adrian surges stand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Venice, and gave the sea laws of command:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now Jove, said he, object thy Capitol,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Mars’ proud walls: this were for to extol</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tyber beyond the main; both towns behold;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rome, men thou’lt say, Venice the Gods did mould.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sannazaro had given him by Saint Mark a hundred
zecchins, for every one of these verses, which amounts
to about 300 pounds. It would be long before the
city of London would do the like. Witness that cold
reward, or rather those cold drops of water which were
cast upon my countryman, Sir Hugh Middleton, for
bringing Ware River through her streets, the most
serviceable and wholesomest benefit that ever she
received.</p>

<a id="p_48"></a>A PEERLESS CITY<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Safe</span> at Venice. A place whose strange and passing
beauty is well known to thee by report of our mariners.
Dost mind too how Peter would oft fill our ears withal,
we handed beneath the table, and he still discoursing
of this sea-enthroned and peerless city, in shape a
bow, and its great canal and palaces on piles, and its
watery ways plied by scores of gilded boats; and that
market-place of nations, orbis, non urbis, forum,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark his place? And his statue with the peerless
jewels in his eyes, and the lion at his gate? But I,
lying at my window in pain, may see none of these
beauties as yet, but only a street, fairly paved, which
is dull, and houses with oiled paper and linen, in lieu
of glass, which is rude; and the passers-by, their habits
and their gestures, wherein they are superfluous.
Therefore, not to miss my daily comfort of whispering
to thee, I will e’en turn mine eyes inward, and bind
my sheaves of wisdom reaped by travel. For I love
thee so, that no treasure pleases me not shared with
thee; and what treasure so good and enduring as
knowledge? This then have I, Sir Footsore, learned,
that each nation hath its proper wisdom, and its
proper folly; and methinks, could a great king, or
duke, tramp like me, and see with his own eyes, he
might pick the flowers, and eschew the weeds of
nations, and go home and set his own folk on Wisdom’s
hill....</p>

<p>The Italians are a polished and subtle people. They
judge a man, not by his habits, but his speech and
gesture. Here Sir Chough may by no means pass for
falcon gentle, as did I in Germany, pranked in my
noble servant’s feathers. Wisest of all nations in their
singular temperance of food and drink. Most foolish of
all to search strangers coming into their borders, and
stay them from bringing much money in. They should
rather invite it, and like other nations, let the traveller
from taking of it out. Also here in Venice the dames
turn their black hair yellow by the sun and art, to be
wiser than Him who made them. Ye enter no Italian
town without a bill of health, though now is no plague
in Europe. This peevishness is for extortion’s sake.
The innkeepers cringe and fawn, and cheat, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
country places, murder you. Yet will they give you
clean sheets by paying therefor. Delicate in eating, and
abhor from putting their hand in the plate; sooner
they will apply a crust or what not. They do even tell
of a cardinal at Rome, which armeth his guest’s left
hand with a little bifurcal dagger to hold the meat,
while his knife cutteth it. But methinks this, too, is to
be wiser than Him, who made the hand so supple and
prehensile....</p>

<p>Their bread is lovely white. Their meats they spoil
with sprinkling cheese over them; O, perversity!
Their salt is black; without a lie. In commerce these
Venetians are masters of the earth and sea; and govern
their territories wisely.... Also, in religion, they hang
their cloth according to the wind, siding now with the
Pope, now with the Turk; but aye with the god of
traders, mammon hight. Shall flower so cankered
bloom to the world’s end? But since I speak of
flowers, this none may deny them, that they are most
cunning in making roses and gilliflowers to blow unseasonably.
In summer they nip certain of the budding
roses and water them not. Then in winter they
dig round these discouraged plants, and put in cloves;
and so with great art rear sweet-scented roses, and
bring them to market in January....</p>

<p>Sweetheart, I must be brief, and tell thee but a part
of that I have seen, for this day my journal ends.
To-night it sails for thee, and I, unhappy, not with it,
but to-morrow, in another ship, to Rome.</p>

<p>Dear Margaret, I took a hand litter, and was carried
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark his church. Outside it, towards the
market-place, is a noble gallery, and above it four
famous horses, cut in brass by the ancient Romans,
and seem all moving, and at the very next step must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
needs leap down on the beholder. About the church
are six hundred pillars of marble, porphyry, and
ophites. Inside is a treasure greater than either at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Denys, or Loretto, or Toledo. Here a jewelled pitcher
given the seigniory by a Persian king, also the ducal
cap blazing with jewels, and on its crown a diamond
and a chrysolite, each as big as an almond; two golden
crowns and twelve golden stomachers studded with
jewels, from Constantinople; item, a monstrous sapphire;
item, a great diamond given by a French
king; item, a prodigious carbuncle; item, three
unicorns’ horns. But what are these compared with
the sacred relics?</p>

<p>Dear Margaret, I stood and saw the brazen chest
that holds the body of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark the Evangelist. I saw
with these eyes and handled his ring, and his gospel
written with his own hand, and all my travels seemed
light; for who am I that I should see such things?
Dear Margaret, his sacred body was first brought from
Alexandria by merchants in 810, and then not prized
as now; for between 829, when this church was builded,
and 1094, the very place where it lay was forgotten.
Then holy priests fasted and prayed many days seeking
for light, and lo! the Evangelist’s body brake at
midnight through the marble and stood before them.
They fell to the earth; but in the morning found the
crevice the sacred body had burst through, and peering
through it saw him lie. Then they took and laid him
in his chest beneath the altar, and carefully put back
the stone with its miraculous crevice, which crevice
I saw, and shall gape for a monument while the world
lasts. After that they showed me the Virgin’s chair,
it is of stone; also her picture, painted by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Luke,
very dark, and the features now scarce visible. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
picture, in time of drought, they carry in procession,
and brings the rain. I wish I had not seen it. Item,
two pieces of marble spotted with John the Baptist’s
blood; item, a piece of the true cross, and of the pillar
to which Christ was tied; item, the rock struck by
Moses, and wet to this hour; also a stone Christ sat
on, preaching at Tyre; but some say it is the one the
patriarch Jacob laid his head on, and I hold with
them, by reason our Lord never preached at Tyre.
Going hence, they showed me the state nursery for the
children of those aphrodisian dames, their favourites.
Here in the outer wall was a broad niche, and if they
bring them so little as they can squeeze them through
it alive, the bairn falls into a net inside, and the state
takes charge of it, but if too big, their mothers must
even take them home again, with whom abiding ’tis
like to be mali corvi mali ovum. Coming out of the
church we met them carrying in a corpse, with the feet
and face bare. This I then first learned is Venetian
custom, and sure no other town will ever rob them of
it.... But what I most admired was to see over
against the Duke’s palace a fair gallows in alabaster,
reared express to bring him, and no other, for the least
treason to the state; and there it stands in his eye
whispering him memento mori. I pondered, and
owned these signors my masters, who will let no man,
not even their sovereign, be above the common weal.</p>

<a id="p_57"></a>GEORGE ELIOT’S IMPRESSION OF VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">From</span> Padua to Venice! It was about ten o’clock on
a moonlight night—the 4th of June—that we found
ourselves apparently on a railway in the midst of the
sea: we were on the bridge across the lagoon. Soon
we were in a gondola on the Grand Canal, looking out
at the moonlit buildings and water. What stillness!
What beauty! Looking out from the high window of
our hotel on the Grand Canal, I felt that it was a pity
to go to bed. Venice was more beautiful than romances
had feigned.</p>

<p>And that was the impression that remained, and
even deepened, during our stay of eight days. That
quiet which seems the deeper because one hears the
delicious dip of the oar (when not disturbed by
clamorous church bells), leaves the eye in full liberty
and strength to take in the exhaustless loveliness of
colour and form.</p>

<p>We were in our gondola by nine o’clock the next
morning, and of course the first point we sought was
the Piazza di San Marco. I am glad to find Ruskin
calling the Palace of the Doges one of the two most
perfect buildings in the world.... This spot is a
focus of architectural wonders: but the palace is the
crown of them all. The double tier of columns and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
arches, with the rich sombreness of their finely outlined
shadows, contrast satisfactorily with the warmth
and light and more continuous surface of the upper
part. Even landing on the Piazzetta, one has a sense,
not only of being in an entirely novel scene, but one
where the ideas of a foreign race have poured themselves
in without yet mingling indistinguishably with
the pre-existent Italian life. But this is felt yet more
strongly when one has passed along the Piazzetta and
arrived in front of San Marco, with its low arches and
domes and minarets. But perhaps the most striking
point to take one’s stand on is just in front of the
white marble guard-house flanking the great tower—the
guard-house with Sansovino’s iron gates before it.
On the left is San Marco, with the two square pillars
from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jean d’Acre, standing as isolated trophies;
on the right the Piazzetta extends between the Doge’s
palace and the Palazzo Reale to the tall columns from
Constantinople; and in front is the elaborate gateway
leading to the white marble Scala dei Giganti, in
the courtyard of the Doge’s palace. Passing through
this gateway and up the staircase, we entered the
gallery which surrounds the court on three sides, and
looked down at the fine sculptured vase-like wells
below. Then into the great Sala, surrounded with
the portraits of the Doges: the largest oil-painting
here—or perhaps anywhere else—is the ‘Gloria del
Paradiso’ by Tintoretto, now dark and unlovely.
But on the ceiling is a great Paul Veronese—the
‘Apotheosis of Venice’—which looks as fresh as if it
were painted yesterday, and is a miracle of colour
and composition—a picture full of glory and joy of
an earthly, fleshly kind, but without any touch of
coarseness or vulgarity. Below the radiant Venice on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
her clouds is a balcony filled with upward-looking
spectators; and below this gallery is a group of human
figures with horses. Next to this Apotheosis, I admire
another Coronation of Venice on the ceiling of another
Sala, where Venice is sitting enthroned above the
globe with her lovely face in half-shadow—a creature
born with an imperial attitude. There are other Tintorettos,
Veroneses, and Palmas in the great halls of
this palace; but they left me quite indifferent, and
have become vague in my memory. From the splendours
of the palace we crossed the Bridge of Sighs to
the prisons, and saw the horrible dark damp cells that
would make the saddest life in the free light and air
seem bright and desirable.</p>

<p>The interior of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s is full of interest, but not
of beauty: it is dark and heavy, and ill-suited to the
Catholic worship, for the massive piers that obstruct
the view everywhere shut out the sight of ceremony
and procession, as we witnessed at our leisure on the
day of the great procession of Corpus Christi. But
everywhere there are relics of gone-by art to be
studied, from mosaics of the Greeks to mosaics of
later artists than the Zuccati; old marble statues,
embrowned like a meerschaum pipe; amazing sculptures
in wood; Sansovino doors, ambitious to rival
Ghiberti’s; transparent alabaster columns; an ancient
Madonna, hung with jewels, transported from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Sophia, in Constantinople; and everywhere the venerable
pavement, once beautiful with its starry patterns
in rich marble, now deadened and sunk to unevenness
like the mud floor of a cabin.</p>

<p>Then outside, on the archway of the principal door,
there are sculptures of a variety that makes one renounce
the study of them in despair at the shortness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
of one’s time—blended fruits and foliage, and human
groups and animal forms of all kinds. On our first
morning we ascended the great tower, and looked
around on the island-city and the distant mountains
and the distant Adriatic. And on the same day we
went to see the Pisani Palace—one of the grand old
palaces that are going to decay.... After this we
saw the Church of San Sebastiano, where Paul Veronese
is buried, with his own paintings around, mingling
their colour with the light that falls on his tombstone.
There is one remarkably fine painting of his here: it
represents, I think, some Saints going to martyrdom,
but apart from that explanation, is a composition full
of vigorous, spirited figures....</p>

<p>Santa Maria della Salute, built as an <i lang="la">ex voto</i> by the
Republic on the cessation of the plague, is one of the
most conspicuous churches in Venice, lifting its white
cupolas close on the Grand Canal, where it widens
out towards the Giudecca. Here there are various
Tintorettos, but the only one which is not blackened
so as to be unintelligible is the <i lang="it">Cena</i>, which is represented
as a bustling supper-party, with attendants
and sideboard accessories, in thoroughly Dutch
fashion!... But of all Tintoretto’s paintings, the
best preserved, and perhaps the most complete in
execution, is the Miracle of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark at the Accademia.
We saw it the oftener because we were attracted
to the Accademia again and again by Titian’s
Assumption, which we placed next to Peter the
Martyr among the pictures at Venice. For a thoroughly
rapt expression I never saw anything equal to the
Virgin in this picture; and the expression is the more
remarkable because it is not assisted by the usual
devices to express spiritual ecstasy, such as delicacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
of feature and temperament or pale meagreness. Then
what cherubs and angelic heads bathed in light! The
lower part of the picture has no interest; the attitudes
are theatrical; and the Almighty above is as unbeseeming
as painted Almighties usually are: but the
middle group falls short only of the Sistine Madonna.</p>

<p>Among the Venetian painters Giovanni Bellini
shines with a mild, serious light that gives one an
affectionate respect towards him. In the Church of
the Scalzi there is an exquisite Madonna by him—probably
his <i lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</i>—comparable to Raphael’s
for sweetness.</p>

<p>And Palma Vecchio, too, must be held in grateful
reverence for his Santa Barbara, standing in calm,
grand beauty above an altar in the Church of Santa
Maria Formosa. It is an almost unique presentation
of a hero-woman, standing in calm preparation for
martyrdom, without the slightest air of pietism, yet
with the expression of a mind filled with serious conviction.</p>

<p>We made the journey to Chioggia.... Of all
dreamy delights, that of floating in a gondola along
the canals and out on the lagoon is surely the greatest.
We were out one night on the lagoon when the sun
was setting, and the wide waters were flushed with
the reddened light. I should have liked it to last for
hours: it is the sort of scene in which I could most
readily forget my own existence, and feel melted into
the general life.</p>

<p>Another charm of evening time was to walk up and
down the Piazza of San Marco as the stars were
brightening and look at the grand dim buildings, and
the flock of pigeons flitting about them; or to walk
on to the Bridge of La Paglia and look along the dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
canal that runs under the Bridge of Sighs—its blackness
lit up by a gaslight here and there, and the plash
of the oar of blackest gondola slowly advancing....</p>

<p>Farewell, lovely Venice! and away to Verona,
across the green plains of Lombardy, which can
hardly look tempting to an eye still filled with the
dreamy beauty it has left behind.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap small">AN EPITOME<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Having</span> now so amply declared unto you most of the
principall things of this thrise-renowned and illustrious
citie, I will briefly by way of epitome mention most
of the other particulars thereof, and so finally shut
up this narration: There are reported to be in Venice
and the circumjacent islands two hundred Churches
in which are one hundred forty three paire organs,
fifty foure Monasteries, twenty sixe Nunneries, fifty
sixe Tribunals or places of judgment, seventeene Hospitals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
sixe Companies or Fraternities; one hundred
sixty five marble statues of worthy personages,
partly equestriall, partly pedestriall, which are erected
in sundry places of the citie, to the honour of those
that eyther at home have prudently administered the
Commonweale, or abroad valiantly fought for the
same. Likewise of brass there are twenty three,
whereof one is that of Bartholomew Coleon. Also
there are twentie seven publique clocks, ten brasen
gates, a hundred and fourteene Towers for bels to
hang in, ten brasen horses, one hundred fifty wels
for the common use of the citizens, one hundred
eighty five delectable gardens, ten thousand Gondolaes,
foure hundred and fifty bridges partly stony,
partly timber, one hundred and twenty Palaces,
whereof one hundred are very worthy of that name,
one hundred seventy foure courts: and the totall
number of soules living in the citie and about the
same is thought to be about five hundred thousand,
something more or lesse. For sometimes there is a
catalogue made of all the persons in the citie of what
sexe or age soever they be; as we may reade there
was heretofore in Rome in the time of Augustus
Cæsar: and at the last view there were found in the
whole city as many as I have before spoken.</p>

<p>Thus have I related unto thee as many notable
matters of this noble citie, as either I could see with
mine eyes, or heare from the report of credible and
worthy persons, or derive from the monuments of
learned and authenticke writers that I have found in
the citie.... And so at length I finish the treatise
of this incomparable city, this most beautifull Queene,
this untainted virgine, the Paradise, the Tempe, this
rich Diademe and most flourishing garland of Christendome:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
of which the inhabitants may as proudly
vaunt, as I have reade the Persians have done of their
Ormus, who say that if the world were a ring, then
should Ormus be the gemme thereof: the same (I say)
may the Venetians speake of their citie, and much
more truely. The sight whereof hath yeelded unto me
such infinite and unspeakable contentment (I must
needes confesse) that even as Albertus Marquesse of
Guasto said, were he put to his choice to be Lord of
foure of the fairest cities of Italy, or the Arsenall of
Venice, he would prefer the Arsenall: In like manner
I say, that had there bin an offer made unto me before
I took my journey to Venice, eyther that foure of the
richest mannors of Somerset-shire (wherein I was
borne) should be gratis bestowed upon me if I never
saw Venice, or neither of them if I should see it;
although certainly those mannors would do me much
more good in respect of a state of livelyhood to live
in the world, then the sight of Venice: yet notwithstanding,
I will ever say while I live, that the sight
of Venice and her resplendent beauty, antiquities, and
monuments, hath by many degrees more contented
my mind, and satisfied my desires, then those foure
Lordshippes could possibly have done.</p>

<p>To taste in all their fulness his first impressions of Venice,
the traveller should arrive there by sea, at mid-day, when the
sun is high.... He who comes for the first time to Venice
by this route realizes a dream—his only dream perhaps ever
destined to be surpassed by the reality; and if he knows how
to enjoy the things of Nature, if he can take delight in silver-grey
and rose-coloured reflections in water, if he loves light
and colour, the picturesque life of Italian squares and streets,
the good humour of the people and their gentle speech, which
seems like the twittering of birds, let him only allow himself to
live for a little time under the sky of Venice, and he has before
him a season of happiness without alloy.</p>

SAILING TOWARDS VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">To</span> the sea, the wonderful sea!... To Venice, the
strangely floating city, the queen of the Adriatic!...
I knew perfectly that the north of Italy would present
to me a new style of scenery. Venice itself was really
so different to any other Italian city; a richly adorned
bride for the mighty sea. The winged Venetian lion
waved on the flag above me. The sails swelled in
the wind, and concealed the coast from me. I sat
upon the right side of the ship, and looked out across
the blue, billowy sea; a young lad sat not far from
me, and sang a Venetian song about the bliss of
love and the shortness of life: ‘Kiss the red lips, on
the morrow thou art with the dead; love whilst thy
heart is young, and thy blood is fire and flame!
Grey hairs are the flowers of death: then is the blood
ice; then is the flame extinguished! Come into the
light gondola! We sit concealed under its roof, we
cover the windows, we close the door, nobody sees
thee, love! We are rocked upon the waves; the
waves embrace, and so do we. Love whilst youth is
in thy blood. Age kills with frost and with snow!’</p>

<p>As he sang, he smiled and nodded to the others
around him; and they sang in chorus, about kissing
and loving while the heart was young. It was a
merry song, very merry; and yet it sounded like a
magical song of death in my heart.... My heart
desired love: God had ordained it, who had implanted
this feeling within me. I was still young,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
however: Venice was a gay city full of beautiful
women. And what does the world give me for my
virtue, thought I, for my childlike temper? Ridicule,
and time brings bitterness and grey hairs. Thus
thought I, and sang in chorus with the rest, of kissing
and loving, while the heart was yet young....</p>

<p>The vessel flew onward to the north—to the rich
Venice. In the morning hour, I discerned the white
buildings and town of Venice, which seemed like a
crowd of ships with outspread sails. To the left
stretched itself the kingdom of Lombardy, with its
flat coast: the Alps seemed like pale blue mist in the
horizon. Here was the heaven wide. Here the half
of the hemisphere could mirror itself in the heart.</p>

<p>In this sweet morning air ... I thought about
the history of Venice, of the city’s wealth and pomp,
its independence and supremacy; of the magnificent
doges, and their marriage with the sea. We advanced
nearer and nearer to the sea: I could already distinguish
the individual houses across the lagoons....
The sun shone upon Venice: all the bells were ringing.
I stepped down into the black gondola, and sailed up
into the dead street, where everything was water,
not a foot-breadth upon which to walk. Large buildings
stood with open doors, and with steps down to
the water; the water ran into the great doorways,
like a canal; and the palace-court itself seemed only
a four-cornered well, into which people could sail, but
scarcely turn the gondola. The water had left its
greenish slime upon the walls: the great marble
palaces seemed as if sinking together: in the broad
windows, rough boards were nailed up to the gilded,
half-decayed beams. The proud giant-body seemed
to be falling away piecemeal; the whole had an air of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
depression about it. The ringing of the bells ceased,
not a sound, excepting the splash of the oars in the
water, was to be heard, and I still saw not a human
being. The magnificent Venice lay like a dead swan
upon the waves.</p>

<p>We crossed about into the other streets; small
narrow bridges of masonry hung over the canals;
and I now saw people who skipped over me, in among
the houses, and in among the walls even; for I saw
no other streets than those in which the gondolas
glided.</p>

<p>‘But where do the people walk?’ inquired I of my
gondolier; and he pointed to small passages by the
bridges, between the lofty houses. Neighbour could
reach his hand to neighbour, from the sixth story
across the street; three people could hardly pass each
other below, where not a sunbeam found its way.
Our gondola had passed on, and all was still as death.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="smcap">I rode</span> one evening with Count Maddalo</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the bank of land which breaks the flow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Adria towards Venice: a bare strand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of hillocks, heaped from ever-shifting sand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Matted with thistles and amphibious weeds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such as from earth’s embrace the salt ooze breeds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is this; an uninhabited seaside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which the lone fisher, when his nets are dried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Abandons; and no other object breaks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The waste, but one dwarf tree and some few stakes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Broken and unrepaired, and the tide makes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A narrow space of level sand thereon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where ’twas our wont to ride while day went down.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This ride was my delight. I love all waste</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And solitary places; where we taste</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pleasure of believing what we see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And such was this wide ocean, and this shore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More barren than its billows; and yet more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than all, with a remembered friend I love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To ride as I then rode;—for the winds drove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The living spray along the sunny air</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into our faces; the blue heavens were bare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stripped to their depths by the awakening north;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, from the waves, sound like delight broke forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Harmonizing with solitude, and sent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into our hearts aërial merriment.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So, as we rode, we talked; and the swift thought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Winging itself with laughter, lingered not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But flew from brain to brain,—such glee was ours,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Charged with light memories of remembered hours,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">None slow enough for sadness: till we came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Homeward, which always makes the spirit tame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This day had been cheerful but cold, and now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sun was sinking, and the wind also.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our talk grew somewhat serious, as may be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Talk interrupted with such raillery</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As mocks itself, because it cannot scorn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thoughts it would extinguish:—’twas forlorn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet pleasing; such as once, so poets tell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The devils held within the dales of hell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Concerning God, freewill, and destiny.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all that earth has been, or yet may be;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All that vain men imagine or believe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or hope can paint, or suffering can achieve,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Is it not wise to make the best of ill?)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Argued against despondency; but pride</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made my companion take the darker side.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sense that he was greater than his kind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had struck, methinks, his eagle spirit blind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By gazing on its own exceeding light.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Over the horizon of the mountains—Oh!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How beautiful is sunset, when the glow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of heaven descends upon a land like thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou paradise of exiles, Italy!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy mountains, seas, and vineyards, and the towers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of cities they encircle!—It was ours</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To stand on thee, beholding it: and then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Just where we had dismounted, the Count’s men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were waiting for us with the gondola.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As those who pause on some delightful way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though bent on pleasant pilgrimage, we stood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Looking upon the evening and the flood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which lay between the city and the shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Paved with the image of the sky: the hoar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And aery Alps, towards the north, appeared,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through mist, an heaven-sustaining bulwark, reared</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Between the east and west; and half the sky</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dark purple at the zenith, which still grew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Down the steep west into a wondrous hue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brighter than burning gold, even to the rent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the swift sun yet paused in his descent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among the many folded hills—they were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those famous Euganean hills, which bear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As seen from Lido, through the harbour piles,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The likeness of a clump of peakèd <span class="lock">isles—</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then, as if the earth and sea had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dissolved into one lake of fire, were seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those mountains towering, as from waves of flame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Around the vaporous sun, from which there came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The inmost purple spirit of light, and made</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their very peaks transparent. ‘Ere it fade,’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said my companion, ‘I will show you soon</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">We glided; and from that funereal bark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I leaned, and saw the city, and could mark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How from their many isles, in evening’s gleam,</div>

<a id="p_72"></a>VENICE SEEN IN THE DISTANCE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> ... were entering the fertile territory of the
Bassanese. It was now I beheld groves of olives, and
vines clustering the summits of the tallest elms;
pomegranates in every garden, and vases of citron and
orange before almost every door. The softness and
transparency of the air soon told me I was arrived in
happier climates, and I felt sensations of joy and
novelty run through my veins, upon beholding this
smiling land of groves and verdure stretched out
before me. A few hazy vapours, I can hardly call them
clouds, rested upon the extremities of the landscape;
and, through their medium, the sun cast an oblique
and dewy ray. Peasants were returning home, singing
as they went, and calling to each other over the
hills; whilst the women were milking goats before the
wickets of the cottage, and preparing their country
fare....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
Our route to Venice lay winding along the variegated
plains I had surveyed from Mosolente; and
after dining at Treviso we came in two hours and a
half to Mestre, between grand villas and gardens
peopled with statues. Embarking our baggage at the
last-mentioned place, we stepped into a gondola,
whose even motion was very agreeable after the jolts
of a chaise. We were soon out of the canal of Mestre,
terminating by an isle which contains a cell dedicated
to the Holy Virgin, peeping out of a thicket, whence
spire up two tall cypresses. Its bells tinkled as we
passed along and dropped some paolis into a net tied
at the end of a pole stretched out to us for that purpose.
As soon as we had doubled the cape of this
diminutive island, an expanse of sea opened to our
view, the domes and towers of Venice rising from its
bosom. Now we began to distinguish Murano, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michele, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giorgio in Alga, and several other islands,
detached from the grand cluster, which I hailed as old
acquaintances; innumerable prints and drawings
having long since made their shapes familiar. Still
gliding forward, we every moment distinguished some
new church or palace in the city, suffused with the
rays of the setting sun, and reflected with all their
glow of colouring from the surface of the waters.</p>

<p>The air was calm; the sky cloudless; a faint wind
just breathing upon the deep, lightly bore its surface
against the steps of a chapel in the island of San
Secondo, and waved the veil before its portal, as we
rowed by and coasted the walls of its garden overhung
with fig-trees and surmounted by spreading pines.
The convent discovers itself through their branches,
built in a style somewhat morisco, and level with the
sea, except where the garden intervenes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
We were now drawing very near the city, and a
confused hum began to interrupt the evening stillness;
gondolas were continually passing and repassing, and
the entrance of the Canal Reggio, with all its stir and
bustle, lay before us. Our gondoliers turned with
much address through a crowd of boats and barges
that blocked up the way, and rowed smoothly by the
side of a broad pavement, covered with people in all
dresses and of all nations.</p>

<a id="p_74"></a>FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is easy to feel and to say something obvious about
Venice. The influence of this sea-city is unique, immediate,
and unmistakable. But to express the sober
truth of those impressions which remain when the
first astonishment of the Venetian revelation has subsided,
when the spirit of the place has been harmonized
through familiarity with our habitual mood, is difficult.</p>

<p>Venice inspires at first an almost Corybantic rapture.
From our earliest visits, if these have been
measured by days rather than weeks, we carry away
with us the memory of sunsets emblazoned in gold
and crimson upon cloud and water; of violet domes
and bell-towers etched against the orange of a western
sky; of moonlight silvering breeze-rippled breadths
of liquid blue; of distant islands shimmering in sun-litten
haze; of music and black gliding boats; of
labyrinthine darkness made for mysteries of love and
crime; of statue-fretted palace fronts; of brazen
clangour and a moving crowd; of pictures by earth’s
proudest painters, cased in gold on walls of council
chambers where Venice sat enthroned a queen, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
nobles swept the floors with robes of Tyrian brocade.
These reminiscences will be attended by an ever-present
sense of loneliness and silence in the world
around; the sadness of a limitless horizon, the solemnity
of an unbroken arch of heaven, the calm and
greyness of evening on the lagoons, the pathos of a
marble city crumbling to its grave in mud and brine.</p>

<p>These first impressions of Venice are true. Indeed
they are inevitable. They abide, and form a glowing
background for all subsequent pictures, toned more
austerely, and painted in more lasting hues of truth
upon the brain. Those have never felt Venice at all
who have not known this primal rapture, or who
perhaps expected more of colour, more of melodrama,
from a scene which nature and the art of man have
made the richest in these qualities. Yet the mood
engendered by this first experience is not destined to
be permanent. It contains an element of unrest and
unreality which vanishes upon familiarity. From the
blare of that triumphal bourdon of brass instruments
emerge the delicate voices of violin and clarinet. To
the contrasted passions of our earliest love succeed
a multitude of sweet and fanciful emotions. It is my
present purpose to recapture some of the impressions
made by Venice in more tranquil moods. Memory
might be compared to a kaleidoscope. Far away from
Venice I raise the wonder-working tube, allow the
glittering fragments to settle as they please, and with
words attempt to render something of the patterns
I behold.</p>

TOWARDS VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> gates were opened and we passed into the sea.
There was a ‘breath of Venice in the breeze;’ the
odour of the lagoons, clear and pungent; a scent that
seems to penetrate the being, to reach the very heart,
and charms it to surrender. The evening wind sprang
up behind, and we set our sail and prow for Venice,
twenty-five miles away across the pearly grey lagoon.
On and on we sailed while the day faded about us,
deepening slowly into night. A fiery sunset flamed
itself to death behind the Euganean Hills. The
expanse of water quickened from grey to crimson,
to gold, to orange, to pale burnished copper, dimpled
and shadowed by the tiny waves, to purple as the
night came down; then all this glory of colour withdrew
once more into the pervasive pearly grey, as the
last light died in the western heavens, and darkness
stole silently over the waters....</p>

<p>It is the people and the place, the union and interpenetration
of the two, the sea life of these dwellers
in the city that is always ‘just putting out to sea,’
which constitutes for many the peculiar and enduring
charm of Venice. The people and the place so intimately
intermingled through all their long history,
have grown into a single life charged with the richness
of sea-nature and the warmth of human emotion.
From both together escapes this essence or soul of
Venice which we would clasp with all the ardour of
a lover. Venice, her lagoons, her seafaring folk,
become the object of a passionate idolatry which
admits no other allegiance in the hearts that have
known its power. To leave her is a sure regret; to
return a certain joy.</p>

<h3 class="break">
THE APPROACH TO VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> come to a low wharf or quay at the extremity
of a canal, with long steps on each side down to the
water, which latter we fancy for an instant has become
black with stagnation; another glance undeceives us,—it
is covered with the black boats of Venice. We
enter one of them, rather to try if they be real boats
or not, than with any definite purpose, and glide away;
at first feeling as if the water were yielding continually
beneath the boat and letting her sink into soft vacancy.
It is something clearer than any water we have seen
lately, and of a pale green; the banks only two or
three feet above it, of mud and rank grass, with here
and there a stunted tree; gliding swiftly past the
small casement of the gondola, as if they were dragged
by upon a painted scene.</p>

<p>Stroke by stroke, we count the plunges of the oar,
each heaving up the side of the boat slightly as her
silver beak shoots forward. We lose patience, and
extricate ourselves from the cushions: the sea air
blows keenly by, as we stand leaning on the roof of
the floating cell. In front, nothing to be seen but
long canal and level bank; to the west, the tower of
Mestre is lowering fast, and behind it there have risen
purple shades, of the colour of dead rose-leaves, all
round the horizon, feebly defined against the afternoon
sky,—the Alps of Bassano. Forward still: the
endless canal bends at last, and then breaks into
intricate angles about some low bastions, now torn
to pieces and staggering in ugly rents towards the
water,—the bastions of the fort of Malghera. Another
turn, and another perspective of canal; but not interminable.
The silver beak cleaves it fast,—it widens:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
the rank grass of the banks sinks lower and lower,
and at last dies in tawny knots along an expanse of
weedy shore. Over it, on the right, but a few years
back, we might have seen the lagoon stretching to
the horizon, and the warm southern sky bending over
Malamocco to the sea. Now we can see nothing but
what seems a low and monotonous dockyard wall,
with flat arches to let the tide through it;—this is
the railroad bridge, conspicuous above all things. But
at the end of those dismal arches there rises, out of the
wide water, a straggling line of low and confused brick
buildings, which, but for the many towers which are
mingled among them, might be the suburbs of an
English manufacturing town. Four or five domes,
pale, and, apparently at a greater distance, rise over
the centre of the line; but the object which first
catches the eye is a sullen cloud of black smoke brooding
over the northern half of it, and which issues from
the belfry of a church.</p>

<p>It is Venice.</p>

<a id="p_78"></a>THE THRONE OF VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the olden days of travelling, now to return no more,
in which distance could not be vanquished without
toil, but in which that toil was rewarded, partly by
the power of deliberate survey of the countries through
which the journey lay, and partly by the happiness of
the evening hours, when, from the top of the last hill
he had surmounted, the traveller beheld the quiet
village where he was to rest, scattered among the
meadows beside its valley stream; or, from the long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
hoped for turn in the dusty perspective of the causeway,
saw, for the first time, the towers of some famed
city, faint in the rays of sunset—hours of peaceful
and thoughtful pleasure, for which the rush of the
arrival in the railway station is perhaps not always,
or to all men, an equivalent,—in those days, I say,
when there was something more to be anticipated and
remembered in the first aspect of each successive
halting-place, than a new arrangement of glass roofing
and iron girder, there were few moments of which the
recollection was more fondly cherished by the traveller,
than that which ... brought him within sight of
Venice, as his gondola shot into the open lagoon
from the canal of Mestre. Not but that the aspect of
the city itself was generally the source of some slight
disappointment, for, seen in this direction, its buildings
are far less characteristic than those of the other
great towns of Italy; but this inferiority was partly
disguised by distance, and more than atoned for by
the strange rising of its walls and towers out of the
midst, as it seemed, of the deep sea, for it was impossible
that the mind or the eye could at once comprehend
the shallowness of the vast sheet of water which
stretched away in leagues of rippling lustre to the
north and south, or trace the narrow line of islets
bounding it to the east. The salt breeze, the white
moaning sea-birds, the masses of black weed separating
and disappearing gradually, in knots of heaving
shoal, under the advance of the steady tide, all proclaimed
it to be indeed the ocean on whose bosom the
great city rested so calmly; not such blue, soft, lake-like
ocean as bathes the Neapolitan promontories,
or sleeps beneath the marble rocks of Genoa, but a
sea with the bleak power of our own northern waves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
yet subdued into a strange spacious rest, and changed
from its angry pallor into a field of burnished gold, as
the sun declined behind the belfry tower of the lonely
island church, fitly named ‘<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George of the Seaweed.’
As the boat drew nearer to the city, the coast which
the traveller had just left sank behind him into one
long, low, sad-coloured line, tufted irregularly with
brushwood and willows: but, at what seemed its
northern extremity, the hills of Arqua rose in a dark
cluster of purple pyramids, balanced on the bright
mirage of the lagoon; two or three smooth surges of
inferior hill extended themselves about their roots,
and beyond these, beginning with the craggy peaks
above Vicenza, the chain of the Alps girded the whole
horizon to the north—a wall of jagged blue, here and
there showing through its clefts a wilderness of misty
precipices, fading far back into the recesses of Cadore,
and itself rising and breaking away eastward, where
the sun struck opposite upon its snow, into mighty
fragments of peaked light, standing up behind the
barred clouds of evening, one after another, countless,
the crown of the Adrian Sea, until the eye turned back
from pursuing them, to rest upon the nearer burning of
the campaniles of Murano, and on the great city,
where it magnified itself along the waves, as the quick,
silent pacing of the gondola drew nearer and nearer.
And at last, when its walls were reached, and the
outmost of its untrodden streets was entered, not
through towered gate or guarded rampart, but as a
deep inlet between two rocks of coral in the Indian
Sea; when first upon the traveller’s sight opened the
long ranges of columned palaces,—each with its black
boat moored at the portal,—each with its image cast
down, beneath its feet, upon that green pavement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
which every breeze broke into new fantasies of rich
tessellation; when first, at the extremity of the bright
vista, the shadowy Rialto threw its colossal curve
slowly forth from behind the palace of the Camerlenghi;
that strange curve, so delicate, so adamantine,
strong as a mountain cavern, graceful as a bow just
bent; when first, before its moonlike circumference
was all risen, the gondolier’s cry, ‘Ah! Stalì,’ struck
sharp upon the ear, and the prow turned aside under
the mighty cornices that half met over the narrow
canal, where the splash of the water followed close and
loud, ringing along the marble by the boat’s side;
and when at last that boat darted forth upon the
breadth of silver sea, across which the front of the
Ducal palace, flushed with its sanguine veins, looks
to the snowy dome of Our Lady of Salvation, it was
no marvel that the mind should be so deeply entranced
by the visionary charm of a scene so beautiful and so
strange, as to forget the darker truths of its history
and its being. Well might it seem that such a city
had owed her existence rather to the rod of the enchanter
than the fear of the fugitive; that the waters
which encircled her had been chosen for the mirror
of her state, rather than the shelter of her nakedness;
and that all which in nature was wild or merciless,—Time
and Decay, as well as the waves and tempests,—had
been won to adorn her instead of to destroy, and
might still spare, for ages to come, that beauty which
seemed to have fixed for its throne the sands of the
hour-glass as well as of the sea.</p>

<p>And although the last few eventful years, fraught with
change to the face of the whole earth, have been more
fatal in their influence on Venice than the five hundred
that preceded them; though the noble landscape of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
approach to her can now be seen no more, or seen only
by a glance, as the engine slackens its rushing on the
iron line; and though many of her palaces are for ever
defaced, and many in desecrated ruins, there is still
so much of magic in her aspect that the hurried
traveller, who must leave her before the wonder of
that first aspect has been worn away, may still be led
to forget the humility of her origin, and to shut his
eyes to the depth of her desolation. They, at least,
are little to be envied, in whose hearts the great
charities of the imagination lie dead, and for whom
the fancy has no power to repress the importunity of
painful impressions, or to raise what is ignoble, and
disguise what is discordant, in a scene so rich in its
remembrances, so surpassing in its beauty. But for
this work of the imagination there must be no permission
during the task which is before us. The
impotent feelings of romance, so singularly characteristic
of this century, may indeed gild, but never save,
the remains of those mightier ages to which they are
attached like climbing flowers; and they must be
torn away from the magnificent fragments, if we would
see them as they stood in their own strength. Those
feelings, always as fruitless as they are fond, are in
Venice not only incapable of protecting, but even of
discerning, the objects to which they ought to have
been attached. The Venice of modern fiction and
drama is a thing of yesterday, a mere efflorescence of
decay, a stage dream which the first ray of daylight
must dissipate into dust. No prisoner, whose name
is worth remembering, or whose sorrow deserved
sympathy, ever crossed that ‘Bridge of Sighs,’ which
is the centre of the Byronic ideal of Venice; no great
merchant of Venice ever saw that Rialto under which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
the traveller now passes with breathless interest: the
statue which Byron makes Faliero address as of one
of his great ancestors was erected to a soldier of fortune
a hundred and fifty years after Faliero’s death; and
the most conspicuous parts of the city have been so
entirely altered in the course of the last three centuries
that if Henry Dandolo or Francis Foscari could be
summoned from their tombs, and stood each on the
deck of his galley at the entrance of the Grand Canal,
that renowned entrance, the painter’s favourite subject,
the novelist’s favourite scene, where the water
first narrows by the steps of the Church of La
Salute,—the mighty Doges would not know in what
part of the world they stood, would literally not
recognize one stone of the great city, for whose sake,
and by whose ingratitude, their grey hairs had been
brought down with bitterness to the grave. The
remains of <em>their</em> Venice lie hidden behind the cumbrous
masses which were the delight of the nation in its
dotage; hidden in many a grass-grown court, and
silent pathway, and lightless canal, where the slow
waves have sapped their foundations for five hundred
years, and must soon prevail over them for ever. It
must be our task to glean and gather them forth, and
restore out of them some faint image of the lost city;
more gorgeous a thousandfold than that which now
exists, yet not created in the day-dream of the prince,
nor by the ostentation of the noble, but built by iron
hands and patient hearts, contending against the
adversity of nature and the fury of man, so that its
wonderfulness cannot be grasped by the indolence of
imagination, but only after frank inquiry into the
true nature of that wild and solitary scene, whose
restless tides and trembling sands did indeed shelter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
the birth of the city, but long denied her
dominion.</p>

<p>When the eye falls casually on a map of Europe,
there is no feature by which it is more likely to be
arrested than the strange sweeping loop formed by
the junction of the Alps and Apennines, and enclosing
the great basin of Lombardy. This return of the
mountain chain upon itself causes a vast difference in
the character of the distribution of its débris on its
opposite sides. The rock fragments and sediments
which the torrents on the north side of the Alps bear
into the plains are distributed over a vast extent of
country, and, though here and there lodged in beds of
enormous thickness, soon permit the firm substrata to
appear from underneath them; but all the torrents
which descend from the southern side of the High Alps,
and from the northern slope of the Apennines, meet
concentrically in the recess or mountain bay which
the two ridges enclose; every fragment which thunder
breaks out of their battlements, and every grain of
dust which the summer rain washes from their pastures,
is at last laid at rest in the blue sweep of the
Lombardic plain; and that plain must have risen
within its rocky barriers as a cup fills with wine, but
for two contrary influences which continually depress,
or disperse from its surface, the accumulation of the
ruins of ages.</p>

<p>I will not tax the reader’s faith in modern science
by insisting on the singular depression of the surface
of Lombardy, which appears for many centuries to
have taken place steadily and continually; the main
fact with which we have to do is the gradual transport,
by the Po and its great collateral rivers, of vast
masses of the finer sediment to the sea. The character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
of the Lombardic plains is most strikingly expressed
by the ancient walls of its cities, composed for the
most part of large rounded Alpine pebbles alternating
with narrow courses of brick; and was curiously illustrated
in 1848, by the ramparts of these same pebbles
thrown up four or five feet high round every field, to
check the Austrian cavalry in the battle under the
walls of Verona. The finer dust among which these
pebbles are dispersed is taken up by the rivers, fed
into continual strength by the Alpine snow, so that,
however pure their waters may be when they issue
from the lakes at the foot of the great chain, they
become of the colour and opacity of clay before they
reach the Adriatic; the sediment which they bear is
at once thrown down as they enter the sea, forming a
vast belt of low land along the eastern coast of Italy.
The powerful stream of the Po of course builds forward
the fastest; on each side of it, north and south, there
is a tract of marsh, fed by more feeble streams, and
less liable to rapid change than the delta of the central
river. In one of these tracts is built Ravenna, and
in the other <span class="smcap">Venice</span>.</p>

<p>What circumstances directed the peculiar arrangement
of this great belt of sediment in the earliest times
it is not here the place to inquire. It is enough for us
to know that from the mouths of the Adige to those
of the Piave there stretches, at a variable distance of
from three to five miles from the actual shore, a bank
of sand, divided into long islands by narrow channels
of sea. The space between this bank and the true
shore consists of the sedimentary deposits from these
and other rivers, a great plain of calcareous mud,
covered, in the neighbourhood of Venice, by the sea
at high water, to the depth in most places of a foot or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
a foot and a half, and nearly everywhere exposed at
low tide, but divided by an intricate network of narrow
and winding channels, from which the sea never
retires. In some places, according to the run of the
currents, the land has risen into marshy islets, consolidated,
some by art, and some by time, into ground
firm enough to be built upon, or fruitful enough to be
cultivated: in others, on the contrary, it has not
reached the sea-level; so that, at the average low
water, shallow lakelets glitter among its irregularly
exposed fields of seaweed. In the midst of the
largest of these, increased in importance by the confluence
of several large river channels towards one of
the openings in the sea bank, the city of Venice itself
is built, on a crowded cluster of islands; the various
plots of higher ground which appear to the north and
south of this central cluster have at different periods
been also thickly inhabited, and now bear, according
to their size, the remains of cities, villages, or isolated
convents and churches, scattered among spaces of
open ground, partly waste and encumbered by ruins,
partly under cultivation for the supply of the metropolis.</p>

<p>The average rise and fall of the tide is about three
feet (varying considerably with the seasons); but this
fall, on so flat a shore, is enough to cause continual
movement in the waters, and in the main canals to
produce a reflux which frequently runs like a mill
stream. At high water no land is visible for many
miles to the north or south of Venice, except in the
form of small islands crowned with towers or gleaming
with villages: there is a channel, some three miles
wide, between the city and the mainland, and some
mile and a half wide between it and the sandy breakwater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
called the Lido, which divides the lagoon from
the Adriatic, but which is so low as hardly to disturb
the impression of the city’s having been built in the
midst of the ocean, although the secret of its true position
is partly, yet not painfully, betrayed by the
clusters of piles set to mark the deep-water channels,
which undulate far away in spotty chains like the
studded backs of huge sea-snakes, and by the quick
glittering of the crisped and crowded waves that flicker
and dance before the strong winds upon the unlifted
level of the shallow sea. But the scene is widely
different at low tide. A fall of eighteen or twenty
inches is enough to show ground over the greater part
of the lagoon; and at the complete ebb the city is
seen standing in the midst of a dark plain of seaweed,
of gloomy green, except only where the larger branches
of the Brenta and its associated streams converge
towards the port of the Lido. Through this salt and
sombre plain the gondola and the fishing-boat
advance by tortuous channels, seldom more than four
or five feet deep, and often so choked with slime that
the heavier keels furrow the bottom till their crossing
tracts are seen through the clear sea water like the
ruts upon a wintry road, and the oar leaves blue gashes
upon the ground at every stroke, or is entangled
among the thick weed that fringes the banks with the
weight of its sullen waves, leaning to and fro upon
the uncertain sway of the exhausted tide. The scene
is often profoundly oppressive, even at this day, when
every plot of higher ground bears some fragment of
fair building: but, in order to know what it was once,
let the traveller follow in his boat at evening the
windings of some unfrequented channel far into the
midst of the melancholy plain; let him remove, in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
imagination, the brightness of the great city that
still extends itself in the distance, and the walls and
towers from the islands that are near; and so wait,
until the bright investiture, and sweet warmth of the
sunset are withdrawn from the waters, and the
black desert of their shore lies in its nakedness
beneath the night, pathless, comfortless, infirm, lost
in dark languor and fearful silence, except where the
salt runlets plash into the tideless pools, or the sea-birds
flit from their margins with a questioning cry;
and he will be enabled to enter in some sort into the
horror of heart with which this solitude was anciently
chosen by man for his habitation. They little thought,
who first drove the stakes into the sand, and strewed
the ocean reeds for their rest, that their children were
to be the princes of that ocean, and their palaces its
pride; and yet, in the great natural laws that rule
that sorrowful wilderness, let it be remembered what
strange preparation had been made for the things
which no human imagination could have foretold, and
how the whole existence and fortune of the Venetian
nation were anticipated or compelled, by the setting
of those bars and doors to the rivers and the sea. Had
deeper currents divided their islands, hostile navies
would again and again have reduced the rising city
into servitude; had stronger surges beaten their shores
all the richness and refinement of the Venetian architecture
must have been exchanged for the walls and
bulwarks of an ordinary seaport. Had there been
no tide, as in other parts of the Mediterranean, the
narrow canals of the city would have become noisome,
and the marsh in which it was built pestiferous. Had
the tide been only a foot or eighteen inches higher in
its rise, the water-access to the doors of the palaces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
would have been impossible: even as it is, there is
sometimes a little difficulty, at the ebb, in landing
without setting foot upon the lower and slippery steps;
and the highest tides sometimes enter the courtyards,
and overflow the entrance halls. Eighteen inches more
of difference between the level of the flood and ebb
would have rendered the doorsteps of every palace,
at low water, a treacherous mass of weeds and limpets,
and the entire system of water-carriage for the higher
classes, in their easy and daily intercourse, must have
been done away with. The streets of the city would
have been widened, its network of canals filled up,
and all the peculiar character of the place and the
people destroyed.</p>

<p>The reader may perhaps have felt some pain in the
contrast between this faithful view of the site of the
Venetian Throne and the romantic conception of it
which we ordinarily form: but this pain, if he have
felt it, ought to be more than counterbalanced by
the value of the instance thus afforded to us at once
of the inscrutableness and the wisdom of the ways of
God. If, two thousand years ago, we had been permitted
to watch the slow settling of the slime of those
turbid rivers into the polluted sea, and the gaining
upon its deep and fresh waters of the lifeless, impassable,
unvoyageable plain, how little could we have
understood the purpose with which those islands were
shaped out of the void, and the torpid waters enclosed
with their desolate walls of sand! How little could
we have known, any more than of what now seems to
us most distressful, dark, and objectless, the glorious
aim which was then in the mind of Him in whose
hands are all the corners of the earth! how little
imagined that in the laws which were stretching forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
the gloomy margins of those fruitless banks, and feeding
the bitter grass among their shallows, there was
indeed a preparation, and <em>the only preparation possible</em>,
for the founding of a city which was to be set like a
golden clasp on the girdle of the earth, to write her
history on the white scrolls of the sea-surges, and to
word it in their thunder, and to gather and give forth,
in world-wide pulsation, the glory of the West and of
the East, from the burning heart of her Fortitude and
Splendour!</p>

<a id="p_90"></a>THE JEWELLED CROWN OF VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> days before the railway and its bridge had done
away with the island apartness of Venice, it seemed
like a dream of Young Romance to drop through the
narrow canal from Mestre on the mainland and come
upon the far-spread shimmer of the silvery lagoon;
and, rowing slowly, see, through veils of morning
mist, the distant towers, walls, churches, palaces, rise
slowly, one after another, out of the breast of the
waters—silver and rose and gold out of the sapphire,
azure, and pale grey—a jewelled crown of architecture
on the head of slumbering ocean. We forgot
that fairyland had been driven from the earth, and
saw, or dreamed we saw, the city of Morgan le Fay,
or the palaces of the Happy Isles where the Everyoung
found refuge in the sea—so lovely and so dim
the city climbed out of the deep.</p>

<p>That vision is gone, but even now there are few
visions more startling in their charm than that which
befalls the weary traveller when, coming out of the
dark station, he finds himself suddenly upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
marble quay, with a river of glittering waters before
his eyes, fringed with churches, palaces, and gardens;
the broad stream alive with black gondolas, shouts
in his ears like the shouting of seamen; and, lower
in note and cry, but heard more distinctly than all
other sounds, the lapping of the water on the steps
of stone, the rushing of the tide against the boats.
Midst all the wonders of the city, this it is which first
seizes on his heart. It is the first note of the full
melody of charm which the sea in Venice will play
upon his imagination for many a happy day.</p>

THE CITY OF ENCHANTMENT<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I think</span> there can be nothing else in the world so full
of glittering and exquisite surprise as that first
glimpse of Venice which the traveller catches as he
issues from the railway station by night, and looks
upon her peerless strangeness. There is something
in the blessed breath of Italy (how quickly; coming
South, you know it, and how bland it is, after the
harsh, transalpine air!) which prepares you for your
nocturnal advent into the place; and O you! whoever
you are, that journey toward this enchanted
city for the first time, let me tell you how happy I
count you! There lies before you for your pleasure
the spectacle of such singular beauty as no picture
can ever show you nor book tell you,—beauty which
you shall feel perfectly but once, and regret for ever.</p>

<p>For my own part, as the gondola slipped away
from the blaze and bustle of the station down the
gloom and silence of the broad canal, I forgot that I
had been freezing two days and nights; that I was at
that moment very cold and a little homesick. I could
at first feel nothing but that beautiful silence, broken
only by the star-silvered dip of the oars. Then on
either hand I saw stately palaces rise grey and lofty
from the dark waters, holding here and there a lamp
against their faces, which brought balconies, and
columns, and carven arches into momentary relief,
and threw long streams of crimson into the canal. I
could see by that uncertain glimmer how fair was all,
but not how sad and old; and so, unhaunted by any
pang for the decay that afterward saddened me
amid the forlorn beauty of Venice, I glided on. I
have no doubt it was a proper time to think all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
fantastic things in the world, and I thought them;
but they passed vaguely through my mind, without
at all interrupting the sensations of sight and sound.
Indeed, the past and present mixed here, and the
moral and material were blent in the sentiment of
utter novelty and surprise. The quick boat slid
through old troubles of mine, and unlooked-for events
gave it the impulse that carried it beyond, and safely
around sharp corners of life. And all the while I knew
that this was a progress through narrow and crooked
canals, and past marble angles of palaces. But I did
not know then that this fine confusion of sense and
spirit was the first faint impression of the charm of
life in Venice.</p>

<p>Dark, funereal barges like my own had flitted by,
and the gondoliers had warned each other at every
turning with hoarse, lugubrious cries; the lines of
balconied palaces had never ended;—here and there
at their doors larger craft were moored, with dim
figures of men moving uncertainly about on them.
At last we had passed abruptly out of the Grand
Canal into one of the smaller channels, and from
comparative light into a darkness only remotely
affected by some far-streaming corner lamp. But
always the pallid, stately palaces; always the dark
heaven with its trembling stars above, and the dark
water with its trembling stars below; but now innumerable
bridges, and an utter lonesomeness, and
ceaseless sudden turns and windings. One could not
resist a vague feeling of anxiety, in these strait and
solitary passages, which was part of the strange enjoyment
of the time, and which was referable to the
novelty, the hush, the darkness, and the piratical
appearance and unaccountable pauses of the gondoliers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
Was not this Venice, and is not Venice for
ever associated with bravoes and unexpected dagger-thrusts?
That valise of mine might represent
fabulous wealth to the uncultivated imagination.
Who, if I made an outcry, could understand the Facts
of the Situation—(as we say in the journals)? To
move on was relief; to pause was regret for past
transgressions mingled with good resolutions for the
future. But I felt the liveliest mixture of all these
emotions, when, slipping from the cover of a bridge,
the gondola suddenly rested at the foot of a stairway
before a closely-barred door. The gondoliers rang and
rang again, while their passenger ‘divided the swift
mind,’ in the wonder whether a door so grimly bolted
and austerely barred could possibly open into a hotel,
with cheerful overcharges for candles and service.
But as soon as the door opened, and he beheld the
honest swindling countenance of a hotel <i lang="fr">portier</i>, he
felt secure against everything but imposture, and all
wild absurdities of doubt and conjecture at once
faded from his thought, when the <i lang="fr">portier</i> suffered the
gondoliers to make him pay a florin too much.</p>

<p>So, I had arrived in Venice, and I had felt the influence
of that complex spell which she lays upon the
stranger. I had caught the most alluring glimpses of
the beauty which cannot wholly perish while any
fragment of her sculptured walls nods to its shadow
in the canal; I had been penetrated by a deep sense
of the mystery of the place, and I had been touched
already by the anomaly of modern life amid scenes
where its presence offers, according to the humour in
which it is studied, constant occasion for annoyance
or delight, enthusiasm or sadness....</p>

<p>I yet felt curiously at home in Venice from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
first. I believe it was because I had, after my own
fashion, loved the beautiful that I here found the
beautiful, where it is supreme, full of society and
friendship, speaking a language which, even in its
unfamiliar forms, I could partly understand, and at
once making me a citizen of that Venice from which I
shall never be exiled. It was not in the presence of
the great and famous monuments of art alone that I
felt at home—indeed, I could as yet understand their
excellence and grandeur only very imperfectly—but
wherever I wandered through the quaint and marvellous
city, I found the good company of ‘The fair, the
old;’ and to tell the truth, I think it is the best
society in Venice, and I learned to turn to it later
from other companionship with a kind of relief.</p>

<a id="p_99"></a>IN VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">An</span> hour before sunset I arrived at Fusina, and
beheld, four or five miles out at sea, the towers and
cupolas of Venice suffused with a rich golden light,
and rising out of the bright blue waters. Not an exclamation
escaped me. I felt like a man who has
achieved a great object. I was full of calm exultation,
but the strange incident of the morning made me
serious and pensive.</p>

<p>As our gondolas glided over the great lagoon, the
excitement of the spectacle reanimated me. The
buildings that I had so fondly studied in books and
pictures rose up before me. I knew them all; I required
no cicerone. One by one, I caught the hooded
cupolas of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, the tall Campanile red in the sun,
the Morescoe Palace of the Doges, the deadly Bridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
of Sighs, and the dark structure to which it leads. Here
my gondola quitted the lagoon, and, turning up a
small canal, and passing under a bridge which connected
the quays, stopped at the steps of a palace.</p>

<p>I ascended a staircase of marble, I passed through
a gallery crowded with statues, I was ushered into
spacious apartments, the floors of which were marble
and the hangings satin. The ceilings were painted
by Tintoretto and his scholars, and were full of Turkish
trophies and triumphs over the Ottomite. The furniture
was of the same rich material as the hangings,
and the gilding, although of two hundred years’
duration, as bright and burnished as the costly equipment
of a modern palace. From my balcony of
blinds I looked upon the great lagoon. It was one
of those glorious sunsets which render Venice, in spite
of her degradation, still famous. The sky and sea vied
in the brilliant multiplicity of their blended tints. The
tall shadows of her Palladian churches flung themselves
over the glowing and transparent wave out of
which they sprang. The quays were crowded with
joyous groups, and the black gondolas flitted like sea-serpents,
over the red and rippling waters.</p>

<p>I hastened to the Place of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark. It was crowded
and illuminated. Three gorgeous flags waved on the
mighty staffs, which are opposite to the church in all
the old drawings, and which once bore the standards
of Candia, and Cyprus, and the Morea. The coffee-houses
were full, and gay parties, seated on chairs in
the open air, listened to the music of military bands,
while they refreshed themselves with confectionery so
rich and fanciful that it excites the admiration of all
travellers, but which I since discovered in Turkey to
be Oriental. The variety of costume was also great.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
The dress of the lower orders in Venice is still unchanged;
many of the middle classes yet wear the
cap and cloak. The Hungarian and the German
military, and the bearded Jew, with his black velvet
cap and flowing robes, are observed with curiosity. A
few days also before my arrival, the Austrian squadron
had carried into Venice a Turkish ship and two Greek
vessels, which had violated the neutrality. Their
crews now mingled with the crowd. I beheld, for the
first time, the haughty and turbaned Ottoman,
sitting crossed-legged on his carpet under a colonnade,
sipping his coffee and smoking a long chibouque, and
the Greeks, with their small red caps, their high foreheads,
and arched eyebrows.</p>

<p>Can this be modern Venice, I thought? Can this
be the silent, and gloomy, and decaying city, over
whose dishonourable misery I have so often wept?
Could it ever have been more enchanting? Are not
these indeed still subjects of a Doge, and still the
bridegrooms of the ocean? Alas, the brilliant scene
was as unusual as unexpected, and was accounted for by
its being the feast day of a favourite Saint. Nevertheless,
I rejoiced at the unaccustomed appearance of
the city at my entrance, and still I recall with pleasure
the delusive moments, when, strolling about the
Place of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, the first evening that I was in
Venice, I mingled for a moment in a scene that reminded
me of her lost light-heartedness, and of that
unrivalled gaiety which so long captivated polished
Europe.</p>

<p>The moon was now in her pride. I wandered once
more to the quay, and heard for the first time a
serenade. A juggler was conjuring in a circle under
the walls of my hotel, and an itinerant opera was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
performing on the bridge. It is by moonlight that
Venice is indeed an enchanted city. The effect of the
floods of silver light upon the twinkling fretwork of the
Moresco architecture, the total absence of all harsh
sounds, the never-ceasing music on the waters, produce
an effect upon the mind which cannot be experienced
in any other city. As I stood gazing upon
the broad track of brilliant light that quivered over
the lagoon, a gondolier saluted me. I entered his
boat, and desired him to row me to the Grand
Canal.</p>

<p>The marble palaces of my ancestors rose on each side,
like a series of vast and solemn temples. How sublime
were their broad fronts bathed in the mystic light,
whose softened tints concealed the ravages of Time,
and made us dream only of their eternity! And could
these great creations ever die! I viewed them with a
devotion which I cannot believe to have been surpassed
in the most patriotic period of the Republic.
How willingly would I have given my life to have
once more filled their mighty halls with the proud
retainers of their free and victorious nobles!</p>

<p>As I proceeded along the canal, and retired from
the quarter of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, the sounds of merriment
gradually died away. The light string of a guitar alone
tinkled in the distance, and the lamp of a gondola,
swiftly shooting by, indicated some gay, perhaps
anxious, youth, hastening to the general rendezvous
of festivity and love. The course of the canal bent,
and the moon was hid behind a broad, thick arch,
which black, yet sharply defined, spanned the breadth
of the water. I beheld the famous Rialto.</p>

<p>Was it possible? was it true? was I not all this time
in a reverie gazing upon a drawing in Winter’s studio!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Was it not some delicious dream? some delicious
dream from which perhaps this moment I was about
to be roused to cold, dull life? I struggled not to wake,
yet, from a nervous desire to move and put the vision
to the test, I ordered the gondolier to row to the side
of the canal, jumped out, and hurried to the bridge.
Each moment I expected that the arch would tremble
and part, and that the surrounding palaces would
dissolve into mist, that the lights would be extinguished
and the music cease, and that I should find
myself in my old chamber in my father’s house.</p>

<p>I hurried along; I was anxious to reach the centre
of the bridge before I woke. It seemed like the crowning
incident of a dream, which, it is remarkable,
never occurs, and which, from the very anxiety it
occasions, only succeeds in breaking our magical
slumbers.</p>

<p>I stood upon the Rialto; I beheld on each side of
me, rising out of the waters, which they shadowed
with their solemn image, those colossal and gorgeous
structures raised from the spoils of the teeming Orient,
with their pillars of rare marbles, and their costly
portals of jasper, and porphyry, and agate; I beheld
them ranged in majestic order, and streaming with the
liquid moonlight.</p>

<a id="p_103"></a>ENTERING VENICE AT TWILIGHT<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> could exceed Emily’s admiration on her
first view of Venice, with its islets, palaces, and towers
rising out of the sea, whose clear surface reflected the
tremulous picture in all its colours. The sun, sinking
in the west, tinted the waves and the lofty mountains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
of Friuli, which skirt the northern shores of the
Adriatic, with a saffron glow, while on the marble
porticos and colonnades of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark were thrown the
rich lights and shades of evening. As they glided on,
the grander features of this city appeared more distinctly:
its terraces, crowned with airy yet majestic
fabrics, touched, as they now were, with the splendour
of the setting sun, appeared as if they had been called
up from the ocean by the wand of an enchanter,
rather than reared by mortal hands.</p>

<p>The sun, soon after, sinking to the lower world, the
shadow of the earth stole gradually over the waves,
and then up the towering sides of the mountains of
Friuli, till it extinguished even the last upward beams
that had lingered on their summits, and the melancholy
purple of evening drew over them like a thin
veil. How deep, how beautiful was the tranquillity
that wrapped the scene! All nature seemed to repose;
the finest emotions of the soul were alone awake.
Emily’s eyes filled with tears of admiration and sublime
devotion, as she raised them over the sleeping
world to the vast heavens, and heard the notes of
solemn music that stole over the waters from a distance.
She listened in still rapture, and no person of
the party broke the charm by an inquiry. The sounds
seemed to grow on the air; for so smoothly did the
barge glide along, that its motion was not perceivable,
and the fairy city appeared approaching to welcome
the strangers. They now distinguished a voice, accompanied
by a few instruments, singing a soft and
mournful air, and its fine expression, as it sometimes
seemed, pleading with the impassioned tenderness of
love, and then languishing into the cadence of hopeless
grief, declared that it flowed from no feigned sensibility....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
The deep twilight that had fallen over the
scene admitted only imperfect images to the eye,
but at some distance on the sea she thought she perceived
a gondola: a chorus of voices and instruments
now swelled on the air—so sweet, so solemn! seemed
like the hymn of angels descending through the silence
of night! Now it died away, and fancy almost beheld
the holy choir reascending towards heaven; then again
it swelled with the breeze, trembled awhile, and again
died into silence.... The gay and busy scene that
appeared, as the barge approached <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s Place,
at length roused her attention. The rising moon,
which threw a shadowy light upon the terrace, and
illumined the porticos and magnificent arcades that
crowned them, discovered the various company,
whose light steps, soft guitars, and softer voices,
echoed through the colonnades.</p>

<p>The music they heard before now passed Montoni’s
barge in one of the gondolas, of which several were
seen skimming along the moonlight sea, full of gay
parties, catching the cool breeze. Most of these had
music, made sweeter by the waves over which it
floated, and by the measured sound of oars as they
dashed the sparkling tide.... The barge passed on
to the Grand Canal, where Montoni’s mansion was
situated. And here other forms of beauty and of
grandeur, such as her imagination had never painted,
were unfolded to Emily in the palaces of Sansovino
and Palladio, as she glided along the waves. The air
bore no sounds but those of sweetness, echoing along
each margin of the canal, and from gondolas on its
surface, while groups of masks were seen dancing on
the moonlight terraces, and seemed almost to realize
the romance of fairyland.... The singers sung in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
parts, the verses of Ariosto. They sung of the wars
of the Moors against Charlemagne, and then of the
woes of Orlando: afterwards the measure changed,
and the melancholy sweetness of Petrarch succeeded.
The magic of his grief was assisted by all that Italian
expression, heightened by the enchantments of
Venetian moonlight, could give.</p>

<p>‘Venice herself is poetry, and creates a poet out of the dullest
clay.’ It was a poet who spoke, and his clay was instinct with
the breath of genius. But it is true that Venice lends wings to
duller clay; it has been her fate to make poets of many who
were not so before—a responsibility that entails loss on her
as well as gain. She has lived—she has loved and suffered
and created; and the echoes of her creation are with us still;
the pulse of the life which once she knew continues to throb
behind the loud and insistent present.</p>

THE LAGOONS’ PHANTOM SPELL<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> lagoons are full of mysteries of light; they are a
veritable treasure ground of illusion. They are not one
expanse of water over which the light broods with
equable influence; they form a region of various circles,
as it were, of various degrees of remoteness or tangibility.
Almost one feels that each circle must be
inhabited by a spirit appropriate to itself, and that
a common language could not be between them, so
sharp are the limits set by the play of light. On an
early autumn morning, when the sky is clear and
the sun streams full and level upon the clear blue
expanse that separates Venice and Mestre, we seem
to have a firm foothold on this dancing water. It is
a substantial glory; but as our eye flits on from jewel
to jewel in the clear blue paving, a sudden line is
drawn beyond which it may not pass. The rich flood
of vital colour has its bounds, and beyond it lies a
region bathed in light so intense that even colour is
refined into a mystic whiteness—a mirror of crystal,
devoid of substance, infinitely remote; and above it,
suspended in that lucent unearthly atmosphere, hover
the towers of Torcello and Burano, like a mirage of
the desert, midway between the water and the sky.
They hang there in completest isolation, yet with a
precise definition, a startling clearness of contour.
There is no vestige of other buildings or of the earth
on which they stand, only the dome and campanile
of Murano, the leaning spire of Burano and Mazzorbo’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
lightning-blasted tower, their reflections distinctly
mirrored in a luminous medium, half mist,
half water. There is an immense awe in the vision
of these phantoms, caught up into a region where the
happy radiant colour dares not play; and yet not
veiled—clearer in what they choose to reveal than the
near city strong and splendid in the unreserve of the
young day, but so unearthly, so magical, that our
morning spirits scarcely dare accost them. What boat
shall navigate that shining nothingness that divides
them from our brave and brilliant water?</p>

<p>Venice, indeed, at times falls under the phantom
spell. In those mornings of late autumn when the
duel between the sun and the scirocco seems as if it
could not end till day is done and night calls up her
reinforcements of mist, Venice is herself the ghost,
her goblet brimming with a liquor that seems the
drink of death, a perilous, grey, steely vapour. One
only of her islands looms out of the enfolding, foggy
blanket: it is San Michele, the island of the dead.
On such a morning we may visit this abode of shadows,
not at this hour more strange, more ghostly, than the
city.</p>

<a id="p_111"></a>THE SOUL THAT ENDURES<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> an evening of late September Venice revealed
herself to one of her lovers amidst a spectacle beyond
any range of dreams. Evening was closing in upon
the city with cloud and breeze.... The tide was
low, and land and water stretched out in interchanging
coils of olive and azure beneath a purple storm-cloud,
whilst ever against the bar of the Lido rolled
the sea, dyed with that celestial blue that sometimes
steals from the Adriatic into the basin of San Marco<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
to prostrate itself at the conquering Lion’s feet. And
there lay Venice, her form outlined against a flood
of pearl, the water bending in a tender, luminous
bow behind her towers. Far away, across the
mysterious expanse of low lagoon, Torcello and
Burano gleamed out in startling pallor against the
storm, amid a wild confusion of dark earth and glittering
water. The Northern Alps were hidden in darkness
at the horizon, but westward across the mainland
the clear, sharp peaks of the Euganean hills rose
up behind the city’s pearly halo, behind the deep
blue of the surging lowlands, in almost unearthly outline
against the sunset sky. In front of them a livid
fire rolled sullenly along the valley, sending up purple
smoke into the cloud. The storm genie, summoned
by nether powers, was descending to his fearful tryst
behind the Euganeans, but, as he sank, he bent his
face upon the pale form of Venice, his enchantress,
and the fire of his wonder and of his adoration kindled
in all her slumbering limbs a glow of responsive life.
A flood of crimson suffused the pallor of her pearly
diadem, and her maidens, sleeping grey among the
waters round her, unfolded rosy petals upon the
surface of the lagoon.</p>

<p>It is this power of living communion with the daily
pageant in which sun and moon are doge and emperor,
and the stars and the clouds their retinue—this it is
which, finding expression once at Venice in a temporal
glory that has passed away, is the abiding assurance
of her immortality. This is the spirit which, if once
it helped to make her great, still makes her great
to-day, the spirit that endures.</p>

<a id="p_114"></a>THE QUIETUDE OF THE LAGOON<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">What</span> I have learnt about Venice, Venice as a person,
has come to me more or less unconsciously, from living
on the Zattere, where I could see the masts of ships
and the black hulls of barges, whenever I looked
out of my windows on the canal of the Giudecca;
from sitting night after night outside a café in the
Piazza, listening to the military band, watching
people pass, thinking of nothing, only singularly content
to be there; from strolling night after night
down to the promontory of the Dogana, and looking
into the darkness of the water watching a man
catching fish in a net like a shrimping net, while the
sound of the mandolines and of the voices of singers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
who sat in lantern-lighted gondolas outside the
windows of the hotels on the Grand Canal came to
me in a double chorus, crossing one another in a
strange, not inharmonious confusion of tunes; and
especially from the Lido, that long, narrow bank
between the lagoon and the Adriatic, to whose seaward
side I went so often, merely to be there, on the
sand beyond the bathing-huts, watching the quietude
of the sea. On the horizon there would be a long,
tall line of fishing-boats, their red sails floating against
the pearl grey of the sky like the painted wings of
great moths, spread for flight; as you gazed at them,
they seemed to stand there motionless; then, as you
looked away for a moment and looked back again,
one of them would have vanished suddenly, as if it
had gone down into the sea. And the water, which
rippled so gently against the sand at my feet, had
something of the gentleness of colour of that water
which wanders about the shores of Ireland. It
shone, and seemed to grow whiter and whiter, as it
stretched out towards the horizon, where the fishing-boats
stood up in their long, tall fine against the sky;
it had the delicacy, the quietude of the lagoon, with,
in those bright sails, the beckoning of a possible
escape from the monotony of too exquisite things....</p>

<p>Melancholy ... is an element in the charm of
Venice; but a certain sadness is inherent in the very
sound and colour of still water, and a little of the
melancholy which we now feel must always have
been a background of shadow.... Why is it, then,
that the melancholy of Venice is the most exquisite
melancholy in the world? It is because that melancholy
is no nearer to one’s heart than the melancholy
in the face of a portrait. It is the tender and gracious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
sadness of that beautiful woman who leans her face
upon her hands in a famous picture in the Accademia.
The feast is over, the wine still flushes the glass on
the table, the little negro strikes his lute, she listens
to the song, her husband sits beside her, proudly:
something not in the world, a vague thought, a
memory, a forgetfulness, has possessed her for the
moment, setting those pensive lines about her lips,
which have just smiled, and which will smile again
when she has lifted her eyelids.</p>

<a id="p_116b"></a>VENICE: ITS PLEASURABLE MELANCHOLY<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Venice</span>, the Queen of the Adriatic, is distinguished,
not only by the glory of her arts, the strangeness of
her position, the romance of her origin, but by the
great historical memories of her days of power.
These throw an interest over a city which survives
its own glories, and even its own life, like the scenery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
in some great theatre after the play is done and all
the actors are withdrawn. A pleasurable melancholy
grows upon the traveller who wanders among the
churches or glides along on the canals of Venice.
Although misfortune has overcast the city with a
pall of sadness, it still preserves the indefinable grace
of things Italian. Its old magnificence imposes on
the mind, while the charm of its present melancholy
creeps about the heart. And even on the brightest
day, when the unconquerable sun looks down most
broadly on the glittering city of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, silence
and melancholy still hold their court on the canals;
and the most unsentimental spirit yields to the
elegiac influence.</p>

<p>At Venice, he who is happy, he for whom silence
has no charms and who loves the tumult of the
world, soon finds his footsteps dogged by limping
dulness. But those who have known the sorrows of
life return gladly thither; the place is catching—every
corner or open square recommends itself to the
affections. The lightness of the heavens, the even
purity of the air, the steely shine of the lagoon, the
roseate reflections of the walls, the nights as clear as
day, the softness of the Venetian dialect, the trustfulness
and placability of the people, their tolerance
for all men’s humours, and their gentle intercourse—out
of all these results that unseizable and seductive
quality which is indeed Venice, which sings at a man’s
heart, and so possesses and subdues him that he shall
feel far from home whenever he is far from the Piazzetta.</p>

<p>Travel where you will, neither Rome nor Jerusalem,
neither Granada, Toledo, nor the Golden Horn, will
offer you the spectacle of such another enchanted
approach. It is a dream that has taken shape; a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
vision of fairyland turned into reality by human
hands. The order of nature is suspended; the
lagoon is like the heavens, the heavens are like the
sea; these rosy islets carrying temples are like bards
voyaging the sky; and away upon the horizon,
towards Malamocca, the clouds and the green islands
lie mingled as bafflingly as shapes in the mirage of
the desert. The very buildings have an air of dreamland;
solids hang suspended over voids; and ponderous
halls and palaces stand paradoxically supported
on the stone lace-work of mediæval sculptors.
All the principles of art are violated: and out of
their violation springs a new art, borrowed from
the East but stamped with the mark of Venice; in
a while this is transformed and becomes, in the hands
of the Lombardi, the Leopardi, and the Sansovino,
the glory and the adornment of the city. Opulent
and untamed imaginations have spoiled the treasury
of the Magnificoes to build these sculptured palaces
and basilicas of marble and mosaic, to lay their
pavements with precious stones and cover their walls
with gold and onyx and Oriental alabaster. They
used the pillage of Aquileia, Altinum, Damascus, and
Heliopolis. With a nameless daring they raised high
in air, over the porches and among their domes, the
huge antique bronze horses of Byzantium. They sustained
a mighty palace upon pillars whose carvings
seem wrought by workmen in some opiate dream
making them reckless of the cost of time. They
dammed back the sea to set up their city in its place.
In the lagoon, to the sound of strange workmen’s
choruses, they buried all the oaks of Istria and Dalmatia,
of Albania and the Julian Alps. They transformed
the climate of the Illyrian peninsula, leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
plains instead of mountains, and sunburnt deserts in
the place of green and grateful forests; for all the
hills have become palaces, as at the touch of a wand;
and deep in the salt sea the old oaks stand embedded,
sustaining the city of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark.</p>

</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> boat rocks backwards and forwards, to the
gondolier’s circling oar, the shadows dance a delicious
contredanse. Splash, gentle oar; rise, domes and
spires upon the vault; sing, voices, calling along the
water; stream, golden suns, reflected there. The
gondola flies down a narrow passage towards an open
place where the canals diverge; the shadows part,
and fire is streaming from the tumultuous water.
<i lang="it">Sà premi!</i> cry the gondoliers; for a moment all is in
swinging confusion.... Lights flash from the upper
windows of the tall palaces, balconies start overhead
marked upon the sky. Now it is a palace to let, with
wooden shutters swinging in shadow; now we pass
the yawning vaults of great warehouses filled with
saffron and crimson dyes, where barges are moored
and workmen strain at the rolling barrels.... Now
it is the brown wall of some garden terrace; a garland
has crept over the brick, and droops almost to the
water; one little spray encircles a rusty ring hanging
there with its shadow.... Now we touch palace
walls, and with a hollow jar start off once more. Now
comes a snatch of song through an old archway;
here are boats and voices, the gondolier’s earrings
twinkle in the sun; here are vine wreaths, and steps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
where children, those untiring spectators of life, are
clustering; more barges with heavy fruit and golden
treasure go by. A little brown-faced boy is lying
with his brown legs in the sun on the very edge of a
barge, dreaming over into the green water; he lazily
raises his head to look, and falls back again; now a
black boat passes like a ghost, its slender points start
upwards in a line with the curve of yonder spire; now
it is out of all this swing of shadow and confusion
that we cross a broad sweet breadth of sunlight, and
come into the Grand Canal.</p>

<a id="p_123"></a>THE UNWEARIEDNESS OF VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> returning from an excursion ... it is generally at
sunset that one re-enters Venice, the city all ablaze
with purple and gold, the radiance of the descending
orb; the lagoon is a pearly grey studded with the
black points of the piles, and all the campaniles,
domes, and warehouses along the bank seem crowned
with halos of gold.</p>

<p>These are the spectacles—these, and such as are
presented to us by everyday life, which, after a long
sojourn in Venice, end by engrossing our interest
above all others: as though man soon tired of the
works of men, and kept his appetite and desire always
keen, always alive for the works of God only, for
nature and for life. In truth, however passionate a
man may be for the things of art, he is soon surfeited
in so colossal a museum as is the city of Venice; he
comes at last to the pass of looking at Tintoret without
attention, he stands before a Giovanni Bellini without
emotion; masterpiece crowds upon masterpiece,
Titian on Carpaccio, Pordenone on Palma; bronzes,
enamels, triptychs, marbles, figures of doges lying on
their biers, famous condottieri buried in their armour
and standing proud and valorous in the garb of war
upon their sepulchres—all these sights and glories
leave us indifferent.... The truth is, the air of Venice,
the sky and its varying moods, the extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
colouring which the atmosphere throws over everything,
offer a charm which surpasses all others; and
the open air, the lagoon, the life of the port, with the
changing aspect of the pearly waves, that glimmering
surface which Guardi has so well rendered, the trembling
light upon the silvery field all barred by tongues
of sand and dotted by the black points of the piles,
are beyond the highest inspirations of man.</p>

<p>To sit in front of a café on the Riva, with no other
object but that of looking before you, is a keen
pleasure for anyone who has the love of the picturesque.
The incessant movement; the never ungentle pranks
of the motley crowds; those singular colloquies of
which the meaning unfortunately escapes the ear
unfamiliar with the Venetian dialect; the colouring,
the sunshine; the changing effects, the seductive
distances; the constant arrivals of great ships, the
entrance or departure of the Chioggiotes or the Greeks
of Zante, or sailors of Sporades, with their ruddy sails
making blots of colour on the lagoon, and when
stretched like a bow by the wind, showing in the
transparent air the great Virgin rudely painted on
their surface; the caravans of strangers that pass,
with the special character peculiar to each nationality,—methodical
Englishmen,—American ladies with
their long loose hair,—southern Italians high-coloured
and vehement,—blond Germans in spectacles,—quick
Frenchmen running with their noses in the air,—Italian
soldiers with helmets of grey canvas; lastly
the quaint industries sheltered under immense umbrellas;
chance singers, who fling upon the echoes of
the lagoon an air of Verdi or Gordigiani—all this is
what one never wearies of at Venice.</p>

<p>And what new surprises in the streets, and on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
open places great and small! Here you go up some
steps to cross a canal, there the way is barred, and a
little staircase descends right into the water; old
women, worthy copies of the old woman with the
basket of eggs in Titian’s <cite>Presentation of the Virgin</cite>,
brush along the wall, their heads covered up in their
shawls....</p>

<p>Nature, the warm air, the limpid and transparent
atmosphere in which Venice is bathed,—it is the
emotion of this which after all remains the strangest
among your impressions. After a visit to that
prodigious Ducal Palace, where masterpieces are
heaped upon masterpieces, you long to breathe the
clear air and hurry away to the gardens. You pass
along the whole length of the Riva degli Schiavoni, you
get among the shipping, and the farther you go the
better you can see the long front of Venice composing
itself into a single view. You turn from time to time
to enjoy the panorama, for it is the most admirable
scene ever dreamt of by a Desplechin, a Thierry, a
Cambon, a Chapron, a Nolan, or a Rubbé, and when
you lean on the terrace you soon forget the great
works of art on which you have but now been gazing,
in presence of this mighty work of the Master of
masters! The man of letters and the critic in you give
way to the painter, and you are held enchanted by
the spell of these wonderful harmonies. The grounds
of the garden are a light grey, the grass is green, the
trees in the foreground, still bare of leaves, cut out
against the sky the delicate tracery of their boughs,
the water is pearly with diamond spangles and shifting
facets of light as bright as stars; the tongues of
sand and dry places of the lagoon come cutting here
and there with bars of brown that silver mirror; San<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
Giorgio Maggiore, red and white, catches a luminous
reflection; the Grand Canal and its palaces close the
horizon. All is solitary in the gardens, the green
lizards glide quiveringly from sight, a gondolier cries
<i lang="it">alla barca</i>, a pretty little girl passes with bare head,
her hair deftly dressed and draped in her shawl;
stretched on the scanty grass all round, the gondoliers
sleep in the sunshine. All this would no doubt not
satisfy the desires and aspirations of practical minds
and natures hungry for life and change, for sensations
ever new and spectacles ever varied. But for us it is
a world sufficient, and we are not alone in feeling it
to be so. ‘You dwell there in delight,’ says Paul de
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Victor, ‘and you look back to the days of your
sojourn with emotion. Venice casts about you a
charm as tender as the charm of woman. The rosy
atmosphere in which she lies steeped, the shimmer of
her lagoons, the jewelled hues that change with the
changing hour upon her domes, her fascinating vistas,
the masterpieces of her radiant painting, the gentle
temper of her men and women, the sweet and pensive
gladness that you breathe with her very air—all these
are so many divers but interlinked enchantments.
Other cities had admirers, Venice alone has lovers.’</p>

<a id="p_128"></a>‘THE SUN OF VENICE GOING TO SEA’<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Venetian fishing-boats, almost without exceptions
carry canvass painted with bright colours, the favourite
design for the centre being either a cross or a large
sun with many rays, the favourite colours being red,
orange, and black, blue occurring occasionally. The
radiance of these sails and of the bright and
grotesque vanes at the mast-heads under sunlight is
beyond all painting; but it is strange that, of constant
occurrence as these boats are on all the lagoons,
Turner alone should have availed himself of them.
Nothing could be more faithful than the boat which
was the principal object in this picture, in the cut of
the sail, the filling of it, the exact height of the boom
above the deck, the quartering of it with colour;
finally and especially, the hanging of the fish-baskets
about the bows. All these, however, are comparatively
minor merits (though not the blaze of colour which
the artist elicited from the right use of these circumstances),
but the peculiar power of the picture was the
painting of the sea surface, where there were no
reflections to assist it. A stream of splendid colour
fell from the boat, but that occupied the centre only;
in the distance the city and crowded boats threw down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
some playing lines, but these still left on each side of
the boat a large space of water reflecting nothing but
the morning sky. This was divided by an eddying
swell, on whose continuous sides the local colour of
the water was seen, pure aqua-marine (a beautiful
occurrence of closely-observed truth), but still there
remained a large blank space of pale water to be
treated, the sky above had no distinct details and was
pure faint grey, with broken white vestiges of cloud;
it gave no help, therefore. But there the water lay,
no dead grey flat paint, but downright clear, playing,
palpable surface, full of indefinite hue and retiring as
regularly and visibly back and far away, as if there
had been objects all over it to tell the story by perspective.
Now it is the doing of this which tries the
painter, and it is his having done this which made me
say above that ‘no man had ever painted the surface
of calm water but Turner.’ The San Benedetto, looking
towards Fusina, contained a similar passage,
equally fine; in one of the Canale della Giudecca the
specific green colour of the water is seen in front, with
the shadows of the boats thrown on it in purple; all,
as it retires, passing into the pure reflective blue.</p>

</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Embark</span> at the Piazzetta at eleven o’clock on a clear
sweet starlight evening, and tell the gondolier to go
into the canal of the Giudecca. The gondola enters on
the golden track, you have left the custom-house on
your right. The stars touch with light the gold ball
which carries Fortune on it, and the lamp at the foot
of the portico, the steps of which run down into the
water, lights up the white façade, and makes it reflect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
itself in the slightly rippled waters. The faubourg of
the Giudecca is on our left—a red-brown by daylight
and dark by night; a few scattered lanterns alone
break this black ground like the gold sparkles which
appear and disappear on a piece of burning paper,
and sometimes under the stars, as in the picture of
the English painter Orchardson, two lovers exchange
their soft vows ‘in the pale light of stars’ under the
brightly spangled sky.</p>

<p>The Giudecca is long and low, and becomes faint
and almost bluish as it prolongs itself towards the
horizon. The black keels of some boats at anchor, their
masts and fine cordage, outline themselves distinctly
against the clear sky; the dome of the Redentore, the
church of the faubourg, rounds itself above the houses.
On the right we have the Zattere and their quays
with polished flagstones, looking white in the rays of
the moon, with the great palaces, regular and noble,
the little deserted jetties, and here and there the
bridges at the openings of the canals.</p>

<p>The Giudecca is dark; the Zattere is as light as
day, but with that veiled illumination which the
moon throws over everything it floods with its rays.
The silence is profound and the calmness undisturbed;
the distant echoes, the solemn striking of the hour by
the clock of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s, the song of a solitary sailor
guarding his felucca which he has brought timber-laden
from Dalmatia, the voice of a belated gondolier
who sits swinging his legs in that nocturnal reverie
which is like the <dfn>kief</dfn> of the East: who can render this
impression at once sweet and solemn, the incomparable
charms which lulls all longings, and attaches us to
Venice with an imperishable love?</p>

<a id="p_131"></a>NIGHT IN VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">How</span> beautiful is night in Venice! Then music and
the moon reign supreme; the glittering sky reflected
in the waters, and every gondola gliding with sweet
sounds! Around on every side are palaces and
temples, rising from the waves which they shadow
with their solemn forms, their costly fronts rich with
the spoils of kingdoms, and softened with the magic of
the midnight beam. The whole city, too, is poured
forth for festival. The people lounge on the quays
and cluster on the bridges; the light barks skim along
in crowds, just touching the surface of the water,
while their bright prows of polished iron gleam in the
moonshine, and glitter in the rippling wave. Not a
sound that is not graceful: the tinkle of guitars, the
sighs of serenaders, and the responsive chorus of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
gondoliers. Now and then a laugh—light, joyous, and
yet musical—bursts forth from some illuminated
coffee-house, before which a buffo disports, a tumbler
stands on his head, or a juggler mystifies; and all
for a sequin!</p>

<p>The Place of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark ... is distinguished for elegance,
luxury, and enjoyment.... Under a Venetian
moon it is the hour of love and of faro; now is the
hour to press your suit and to break a bank; to glide
from the apartment of rapture into the chamber of
chance. For [other] tastes there is the minstrel, the
conjurer, and the story-teller, goblets of Cyprus wine,
flasks of sherbet, and confectionery that dazzle like
diamonds. And for every one, from the grave senator
to the gay gondolier, there is an atmosphere in itself
a spell, and which, after all, has more to do with human
happiness than all the accidents of fortune and all the
arts of government.</p>

<p>The gondola is one of the great charms of Venice: it alone,
without art, without the genius of artists which arrests one at
every step, would be enough to fascinate the stranger. In
that gentle swinging like the swinging of a hammock, that
light plash of the oar which caresses the ear, that incredible
sensibility of the boat itself, which seems to move like a living
being, in these and in the surrounding silence there is from the
first moment a charm which no one can escape.</p>

palace of the Cornaro and the palace of the Pesaro passed
them, like two opaque giants blackened by time as by the smoke
of a conflagration. The Ca’ d’Oro passed them like a divine
play of stone and air; then the Rialto showed its ample back
already noisy with popular life, laden with its encumbered
shops, filled, ... like an enormous cornucopia pouring on
the shore all around it an abundance of the fruits of the earth.</p>

THE CHARM OF THE GONDOLA<br>
</h3>
</div><!--end chapter header-->
<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the palmy days of the gondolier (for he bore the
traveller all the way from Mestre to Venice) there
was real poetry in the journey, as tower, and campanile,
and dome gathered from the golden haze,
across the narrowing expanse of water.... It was a
vehicle no less pleasant for the longer excursions on
the lagoon. Shaded by its awning, or sheltering under
its black covering, what could be more pleasant than
to slide over the water to the sandy Lido for a refreshing
dip in the Adriatic, or seek the Cathedral of
Murano, or, yet further afield, pass by lonely islets
to visit Torcello and its oldest church? Venice the
silent and the gondola are exactly suited. There is
no more restful mode of locomotion; no vibration, no
rattle, no clatter, nothing but the rhythmic wash of
the water beneath the oar, so curiously handled, or
the gentle ripple as it slides past the sides; no louder
sound except now and again the gondolier’s strange
cry on approaching a corner to warn those beyond it
what direction to take. But the gondolier has another
advantage. Venice is more than a few important
canals, something more than ornate palaces or stately
churches. The waterways among its three score and
ten islands ramify in all directions, and some of the
most picturesque, though often dilapidated, parts of
the city are only properly accessible from the smaller
canals.... Here some ornate balcony overhangs;
then a little canal unexpectedly opens, perhaps with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
its central well. Here a quaintly designed bridge
carries from islet to islet those narrow alleys, means of
communication yet more intricate than the canals
themselves. Sometimes they reveal unexpected phases
of domestic life, such as a group of youngsters indulging
in a bath from their own doorstep, now
disporting themselves in the warm water, now basking
in the sunshine on the stone slabs. Venetian boys
take to the water almost as naturally as ducks; and
the baby, tied for safety to the door-post with a string,
solemnly contemplates the sport. Venice is at its best
in the summer-time.... A refreshing breeze from the
Adriatic often tempers even the midday heat, and
it is a city which needs sunshine almost as much as
London itself.</p>

<a id="p_149"></a>THE SONGS OF THE GONDOLIERS<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> evening I bespoke the celebrated <em>song</em> of the
mariners, who sing Tasso and Ariosto to melodies of
their own. This must actually be ordered, as it is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
to be heard as a thing of course, but rather belongs
to the half-forgotten traditions of former times. I
entered a gondola by moonlight, with one singer
before and the other behind me. They sing their song,
taking up the verses alternately. The melody, which
we know through Rousseau, is of a middle kind,
between choral and recitative, maintaining throughout
the same cadence, without any fixed time. The
modulation is also uniform, only varying with a sort
of declamation both tone and measures, according to
the subject of the verse. But the spirit—the life of
it, is as follows:</p>

<p>Without inquiring into the construction of the
melody, suffice it to say that it is admirably suited
to that easy class of people who, always humming
something or other to themselves, adapt such tunes
to any little poem they know by heart.</p>

<p>Sitting on the shore of an island, on the bank of a
canal, or on the side of a boat, a gondolier will sing
away with a low penetrating voice—the multitude
admire force above everything—anxious only to be
heard as far as possible. Over the silent mirror it
travels far. Another in the distance, who is acquainted
with the melody and knows the words, takes it up
and answers with the next verse, and then the first
replies, so that the one is as it were the echo of the
other. The song continues through whole nights, and
is kept up without fatigue. The further the singers
are from each other, the more touching sounds the
strain. The best place for the listener is half-way
between the two.</p>

<p>In order to let me hear it, they landed on the bank
of the Giudecca, and took up different positions by
the canal. I walked backwards and forwards between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
them, so as to leave the one whose turn it was to sing,
and to join the one who had just left off. Then it was
that the effect of the strain first opened upon me. As
a voice from the distance it sounds in the highest
degree strange—as a lament without sadness: it has
an incredible effect, and is moving even to tears. I
ascribed this to my own state of mind, but my old
boatman said: ‘È singolare, come quel canto intenerisce,
e molto piu quando è piu ben cantato.’ He
wished that I could hear the women of the Lido,
especially those of Malamocco, and Pelestrina. These
also, he told me, sang Tasso and Ariosto to the same
or similar melodies. He went on: ‘In the evening,
while their husbands are on the sea, fishing, they are
accustomed to sit on the beach, and with shrill and
penetrating voice to make these strains resound, until
they catch from the distance the voices of their
partners, and in this way they keep up a communication
with them.’ Is not that beautiful? and yet, it is
very possible that one who heard them close by
would take little pleasure in such tones which have
to vie with the waves of the sea. Human, however,
and true becomes the song in this way: thus is life
given to the melody, on whose dead elements we should
otherwise have been sadly puzzled. It is the song of
one solitary, singing at a distance, in the hope that
another of kindred feelings and sentiments may hear
and answer.</p>

<a id="p_154"></a>THE GONDOLIER’S CRY<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Most</span> persons are now well acquainted with the general
aspect of the Venetian gondola, but few have taken
the pains to understand the cries of warning uttered
by its boatmen, although those cries are peculiarly
characteristic, and very impressive to a stranger....
It may perhaps be interesting to the traveller in
Venice to know the general method of management
of the boat to which he owes so many happy hours.</p>

<p>A gondola is in general rowed only by one man,
<em>standing</em> at the stern; those of the upper classes having
two or more boatmen, for greater speed and magnificence.
In order to raise the oar sufficiently, it rests,
not on the side of the boat, but on a piece of crooked
timber like the branch of a tree, rising about a foot
from the boat’s side, and called a ‘fórcola.’ The
fórcola is of different forms, according to the size and
uses of the boat, and it is always somewhat complicated
in its parts and curvature, allowing the oar
various kinds of rest and catches on both its sides, but
perfectly free play in all cases; as the management of
the boat depends on the gondolier’s being able in an
instant to place his oar in any position. The fórcola<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
is set on the right-hand side of the boat, some six feet
from the stern: the gondolier stands on a little flat
platform or deck behind it, and throws nearly the
entire weight of his body upon the forward stroke.
The effect of this stroke would be naturally to turn
the boat’s head round to the left, as well as to send
it forward; but this tendency is corrected by keeping
the blade of the oar under the water in the return
stroke, and raising it gradually, as a full spoon is raised
out of any liquid, so that the blade emerges from the
water only an instant before it again plunges. A
<em>downward</em> and lateral pressure upon the fórcola is
thus obtained, which entirely counteracts the tendency
given by the forward stroke; and the effort,
after a little practice, becomes hardly conscious,
though, as it adds some labour to the back stroke, rowing
a gondola at speed is hard and breathless work,
though it appears easy and graceful to the looker-on.</p>

<p>If then the gondola is to be turned to the left, the
forward impulse is given without the return stroke;
if it is to be turned to the right, the plunged oar is
brought forcibly up to the surface; in either case a
single strong stroke being enough to turn the light
and flat-bottomed boat. But as it has no keel, when
the turn is made sharply, as out of one canal into
another very narrow one, the impetus of the boat in
its former direction gives it an enormous leeway, and
it drifts laterally up against the wall of the canal, and
that so forcibly, that if it has turned at speed, no
gondolier can arrest the motion merely by strength or
rapidity of stroke of oar; but it is checked by a strong
thrust of the foot against the wall itself, the head of
the boat being, of course, turned for the moment almost
completely round to the opposite wall, and greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
exertion made to give it, as quickly as possible,
impulse in the new direction.</p>

<p>The boat being thus guided, the cry ‘Premi’ is the
order from one gondolier to another that he should
‘press’ or thrust forward his oar, without the back
stroke, so as to send his boat’s head round <em>to the left</em>;
and the cry ‘Stali’ is the order that he should give
the return or upward stroke which sends the boat’s
head round to the <em>right</em>. Hence, if two gondoliers meet
under any circumstances which render it a matter of
question on which side they should pass each other,
the gondolier who has at the moment the least power
over his boat cries to the other ‘Premi,’ if he wishes
the boats to pass with their right-hand sides to each
other, and ‘Stali’ if with their left. Now, in turning
a corner, there is, of course, risk of collision between
boats coming from opposite sides, and warning is
always clearly and loudly given on approaching an
angle of the canals. It is, of course, presumed that the
boat which gives the warning will be nearer the turn
than the one which receives and answers it; and,
therefore, will not have so much time to check itself
or alter its course. Hence the advantage of the turn—that
is, the outside, which allows the fullest swing,
and greatest room for leeway—is always yielded to the
boat which gives warning. Therefore, if the warning
boat is going to turn to the right, as it is to have the
outside position, it will keep its own right-hand side
to the boat which it meets, and the cry of warning is
therefore ‘Premi,’ twice given; first as soon as it can
be heard round the angle, prolonged and loud, with
the accent on the <em>e</em>, and another strongly accented
<em>e</em> added, a kind of question, ‘Prémi-é,’ followed, at
the instant of turning, with ‘Ah Premí,’ with the accent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
sharp on the final <em>i</em>. If, on the other hand, the warning
boat is going to turn to the left, it will pass with its left-hand
side to the one it meets; and the warning cry is,
‘Stálié, Ah Stalí.’ Hence the confused idea in the
mind of the traveller that Stali means ‘to the left,’
and ‘Premi’ to the right; while they mean, in reality,
the direct reverse: the Stali, for instance, being the
order to the unseen gondolier who may be behind the
corner, coming from the left-hand side, that he should
hold as much as possible <em>to his own right</em>; this being
the only safe order for him, whether he is going to
turn the corner himself, or to go straight on; for as
the warning gondola will always swing right across
the canal in turning, a collision with it is only to be
avoided by keeping well within it, and close up to the
corner which it turns.</p>

<p>There are several other cries necessary in the
management of the gondola, but less frequently, so
that the reader will hardly care for their interpretation;
except only the ‘sciar,’ which is the order to the
opposite gondolier to stop the boat as suddenly
as possible by slipping his oar in front of the
fórcola. The <em>cry</em> is never heard except when the
boatmen have got into some unexpected position,
involving a risk of collision; but the action is seen
constantly, when the gondola is rowed by two or
more men (for if performed by the single gondolier
it only swings the boat’s head sharp round to the
right), in bringing up at a landing-place, especially
when there is any intent of display, the boat being
first urged to its full speed and then stopped with as
much foam about the oar-blades as possible, the effect
being much like that of stopping a horse at speed by
pulling him on his haunches.</p>

<span class="smcap">Venice</span>, <i>May 1, 1834</i>.<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> always wish to seize boldly upon beauty, to feel
and know what it is, to know why and how nature
is worthy of your admiration and love. I was explaining
these feelings to our friend the other evening,
as we were passing in a gondola under the sombre
arcade of the Bridge of Sighs. Do you remember the
light which is seen at the end of the canal, and which
is reflected and multiplied in the old and shining
marble of the palace of Bianca Cappello? In all
Venice there is no canalletto more mysterious, more
melancholy. This single light, glancing on all surrounding
objects but enlightening none, dancing on
the water, and appearing to play in the wake of the
passing gondolas, as though it were an <i lang="la">ignis fatuus</i>
attached to their course, made me remember that
long line of lamps which trembles in the Seine, and
which in the water looks like long crooked tracks of
fire.... I was quite absorbed in my customary
fantasies, when I saw upon the canal of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George,
among the other objects upon its surface, a black
spot moving so rapidly as soon to leave all the others
behind. It was the new and brilliant gondola of the
young Catullo. When within sight, I recognized the
flower of our gondoliers, in his nankin vest....
In the interval of dipping the oar into the tranquil
mirror of the lake, from time to time, he threw a
glance of satisfaction upon his resplendent image,
and charmed with his appearance, and penetrated
with gratitude towards the generous soul of his
patron, he managed the gondola with a vigorous
hand, and made her bound over the waters like a
wild duck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
Giulio (Catullo’s brother) was at the other end of
the barque, and seconded his efforts with all the ease
of a true child of the Adriatic. Our friend Pietro
was lying indolently on the carpet of the gondola,
and the beautiful Beppa, seated on the black morocco
cushions, let the wind play among her ebony tresses,
parted on her noble brow, and falling in two long
loose curls upon her bosom.... The gondola
slackened its pace whilst one of the rowers took
breath, and when it neared the shady banks, it
floated idly on the waves which caressed the marble
stairs of the garden. Pietro asked Beppa to sing.
Giulio took his guitar, and Beppa’s voice rose into
the air full of passion as the appeal of a syren. She
sang a verse from a song which Pietro composed for
some fair lady, perhaps for Beppa herself:</p>

<a id="p_159"></a>GONDOLIERS’ MUSIC<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> gondolier, stationed at the <i lang="it">traghetto</i>, invites
passengers by the most miraculous offers: ‘Will you
go to Trieste this afternoon, monseigneur? Here is
a beautiful gondola, that does not fear the tempest
in the open sea, and a gondolier ready to row you,
without stopping, to Constantinople.’ Unexpected
pleasures are the only pleasures in the world. Yesterday
I wished to go and see the moon rise over the
Adriatic; I had never been able to decide Catullo to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
conduct me to the Lido. He pretended, what they
all pretend when they do not wish to obey, that the
water or the wind was contrary.... I was in
desperate ill-humour when we met, just opposite La
Salute, a barque which was floating gently towards
the Grand Canal, leaving behind it, like a perfume,
the sounds of a delightful serenade. ‘Turn the
prow,’ said I to old Catullo; ‘I hope you are strong
enough to follow that gondola.’ Another barque
floating idly by, imitated my example, then a second,
then another; at last all those who were enjoying
the fresh air on the canal, and several even which
were vacant, and whose gondoliers surrounded us,
crying, ‘Music, music,’ with an air, hungry as the
Israelites in the desert for the manna. In ten
minutes a flotilla was formed round these dilettanti;
all the oars were silent, and the barques were left at
the will of the current.</p>

<p>The harmony floated softly in the breeze and the
hautbois sighed so sweetly that each one held his
breath for fear of interrupting its accents so full of
tenderness and love. The violin mingled its voice
so sad,—with such sympathetic yearnings.... Then
the harp gave forth two or three chords of harmonious
sounds, which seemed to descend from heaven, and
promise the caresses and consolation of its angels to
all souls suffering on this earth. Then came the horn
as from the depths of a wood, and each of us might
fancy he saw his first love advance from the forests
of Friuli, and approach with these sounds of joy.
The hautbois replied with sounds more full of passion
than those uttered by the dove seeking her mate in
the air. The violin exhaled its sobs of convulsive
joy, the harp gave forth its full and generous vibrations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
like the palpitations of an ardent breast, and
then the sounds of the four instruments mingled like
happy souls embracing each other before their
departure for a better world. I drank in their accents,
and my imagination heard them after they had ceased
to exist. Their passage left a magic warmth in the
atmosphere, as though Love had agitated it with his
wings.</p>

<p>There was some minutes’ silence, which no one
dared to break. The melodious barque began to flee
before us as though it wished to make its escape,
but we quickly followed in its track; we might have
been compared to a flock of petrels disputing the
possession of a goldfish. We pressed upon its flight
with our prows, like large steel scythes in the moon’s
beams, shining like the fiery teeth of Ariosto’s dragons.
The fugitive achieved its deliverance in the same way
as Orpheus: some chords from the harp reduced us
all to order and silence. At the sound of its light
<i lang="it">arpeggios</i>, three barques ranged themselves on each
side of the one bearing the music, and followed the
<i lang="it">adagio</i> with the most religious slowness. The others
remained behind like a cortège, and this was perhaps
the best situation for hearing. This long file of silent
gondolas, floating gently with the wind on the magnificent
Grand Canal of Venice, was a <i lang="fr">coup-d’œil</i> which
realized the most lovely dreams. Every undulation
of the water, every slight movement of the oars,
seemed to respond sympathetically to the sentiment
of each musical passage, extracted from the harmonious
themes of Oberon and Guillaume Tell.
The gondoliers, erect on the poop, their bold attitudes
clearly defined against the blue atmosphere, seemed

groups of friends and lovers they were conducting.
The moon rose slowly, and peeping curiously over
the roofs, seemed also to listen and love the music.
A palace on one side of the canal, yet plunged in
obscurity, defined upon the clear sky its enormous
Moorish outlines, darker than the gates of hell.</p>

<p>The other shore, illumined by the rays of the full
moon, at that time as large and brilliant as a silver
shield, received the light upon its silent and serene
arcades. These immense piles of fairy-like buildings,
lighted only by the stars, wore an aspect of solitude,
repose, and immobility truly sublime. The slender
statues rising by hundreds into the air seemed
mysterious spirits watching the repose of the quiet
city, slumbering like the Sleeping Beauty in the
Wood, and condemned, like her, to slumber for a
hundred years or more.</p>

<a id="p_162"></a>THE GONDOLIERS OF VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> Venice the gondoliers know by heart long passages
from Ariosto and Tasso, and often chant them with
a peculiar melody. But this talent seems at present
on the decline:—at least, after taking some pains,
I could find no more than two persons who delivered
to me in this way a passage from Tasso. Goldoni, in
his life, however, notices the gondolier returning
with him to the city: ‘He turned the prow of the
gondola towards the city, singing all the way the
twenty-sixth stanza of the sixteenth canto of the
“Jerusalem Delivered.”’ ... Lord Byron has told us
that with the independence of Venice the song of
the gondoliers has died away.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">‘In Venice Tasso’s echoes are no more.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
There are always two concerned, who alternately
sing the strophes. We know the melody eventually
by Rousseau, to whose songs it is printed; it has
properly no melodious movement, and is a sort of
medium between the <i lang="it">canto fermo</i> and the <i lang="it">canto figurato</i>;
it approaches to the former by recitativical declamation,
and to the latter by passages and course, by
which one syllable is detained and embellished.</p>

<p>I entered a gondola by moonlight: one singer
placed himself forwards and the other aft, and thus
proceeded to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Georgio. One began the song:
when he had ended his strophe the other took up the
lay, and so continued the song alternately. Throughout
the whole of it, the same notes invariably returned,
but, according to the subject-matter of the strophe,
they laid a greater or a smaller stress, sometimes on
one and sometimes on another note, and indeed
changed the enunciation of the whole strophe, as the
object of the poems altered....</p>

<p>We got out upon the shore, leaving one of the
singers in the gondola, while the other went to the
distance of some hundred paces. They now began to
sing against one another, and I kept walking up and
down between them both, so as to leave him who
was to begin his part. I frequently stood still and
hearkened to the one and to the other.</p>

<p>Here the scene was properly introduced. The
strong declamatory, and, as it were, shrieking sound,
met the ear from far, and called forth the attention;
the quickly succeeding transitions, which necessarily
required to be sung in a lower tone, seemed like
plaintive strains succeeding the vociferations of
emotions or of pain. The other, who listened attentively,
immediately began where the former left off,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
answering him in milder or more vehement notes,
according as the purport of the strophe required.
The sleepy canals, the lofty buildings, the splendour
of the moon, the deep shadows of the few gondolas
that moved like spirits hither and thither, increased
the striking peculiarity of the scene, and amidst all
these circumstances it was easy to confess the character
of this wonderful harmony.</p>

<p>It suits perfectly well with an idle solitary mariner,
lying at length in his vessel at rest on one of these
canals, waiting for his company, or for a fare; the
tiresomeness of which situation is somewhat alleviated
by the songs and poetical stories he has in
memory. He often raises his voice as loud as he can,
which extends itself to a vast distance over the tranquil
mirror; and as all is still around, he is as it were in
a solitude in the midst of a large and populous town.
Here is no rattling of carriages, no noise of foot passengers:
a silent gondola glides now and then by him,
of which the splashing of oars is scarcely to be heard.</p>

<p>At a distance he hears another, perhaps utterly
unknown to him. Melody and verse immediately
attach the two strangers: he becomes the responsive
echo to the former, and exerts himself to be heard as
he had heard the other. By a tacit convention they
alternate verse for verse; though the song should
last the whole night through, they entertain themselves
without fatigue; the hearers, who are passing
between the two, take part in the amusement.</p>

<p>This vocal performance sounds best at a great
distance, and is then inexpressibly charming, as it
only fulfils its design in the sentiment of remoteness.
It is plaintive, but not dismal in its sound, and at
times it is scarcely possible to refrain from tears....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>I was told that the women of Lido, the long row
of islands that divides the Adriatic from the lagoons,
particularly the women of the extreme districts of
Malamocco and Pelestrina, sing in like manner the
works of Tasso to these and similar tunes.</p>

<p>They have a custom, when their husbands are
fishing out at sea, to sit along the shore in the evenings
and vociferate these songs, and continue to do so
with great violence, till each of them can distinguish
the responses of her own husband at a distance.</p>

<p>How much more delightful and more appropriate
does this song show itself here, than the call of a
solitary person uttered far and wide, till another
equally disposed shall hear and answer him! It is the
expression of a vehement and hearty longing, which
yet is every moment nearer to the happiness of satisfaction.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> gondolas, which everybody knows are black,

<p class="unindent">as I once saw her drawn by a famous hand, to show
a Venetian lady in her gondola and zendaletta, which
is black like a gondola, but wholly calculated like that
for the purposes of refined gallantry. So is the nightly
rendezvous, the café and casino; for whilst Palladio’s
palaces serve to adorn the Grand Canal and strike
those who enter Venice with surprise at its magnificence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
those snug retreats are intended for the relaxation
of those who inhabit the more splendid apartments
and are feigned with exertions of dignity and
necessity of no small expense.... I have asked several
friends about the truth of what one has been always
hearing in England—that the Venetian gondoliers
sing Tasso’s and Ariosto’s verses in the streets at
night, sometimes quarrelling with each other concerning
the merits of their favourite poets; but what I
have been told since I came here of their attachment
to their respective masters, and secrecy when trusted
by them in love affairs, seems far more probable, as
they are proud to excess when they serve a nobleman
of high birth, and will tell you with an air of importance
that the house of Memmo, Monsenigo, or Gratterola
has been served by their ancestors for these
eighty or perhaps a hundred years, transmitting
pride thus from generation to generation, even when
that pride is but reflected only like the mock rainbow
of a summer sky. But hark! while I am writing this
peevish reflection in my room, I hear some voices
under my window answering each other upon the
Grand Canal. It is—it is the gondolieri sure enough;
they are at this moment singing to an odd sort of tune,
but in no unmusical manner, the flight of Erminia
from Tasso’s ‘Jerusalem.’</p>

<a id="p_166"></a>A GONDOLIER OF CHIOGGIA<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent">‘<span class="smcap">Drink</span>, my friends! <i lang="fr">vive la joyeuse Italie, et Venise
la belle</i>!... I am, as you know, the son of a Chioggia
fisherman. Nearly all the natives of this shore have
the thorax well developed, and possess strong voices,
which would be beautiful also, if not early injured by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
struggles, when at sea, with the noise of the wind and
waves.... The Chioggiotes are a handsome race.
They say that a great French painter, Leopolo
Roberto, is now occupied in illustrating their beauty
in a picture, which he will allow no one to see. Though,
as you perceive, my complexion is sufficiently robust,
my father, in comparing me with my brothers, considered
me so frail and delicate, that he would not
teach me either to throw the line, or to manage skiff
or fishing-boat. He showed me only how to handle
an oar with both hands, to row a small boat, and sent
me to gain a living at Venice, in the capacity of
assistant gondolier of the place. It was a great relief
and humiliation for me to enter thus into servitude, to
quit my paternal home, the borders of the sea, and
the honourable and perilous profession of my ancestors.
But I had a fine voice, and knew many fragments of
Ariosto and Tasso. I might make a lively gondolier,
and gain, with time and patience, fifty francs a month
in the service of amateurs and strangers.... Taste
for poetry and music develops itself among us sons of
the people. We had, and we still have (though the
custom threatens to be lost) our bards and our poets,
whom we call <dfn>cupidons</dfn>; rhapsodical travellers, who
bring us from the central provinces incorrect notions
of the mother-tongue, modified—I should better say
enriched, with all the genius of the northern and
southern dialects. Men of the people like us, gifted
at the same time with memory and imagination, they
never care for mixing their fantastic improvisations
with the creations of poets. Always taking, and leaving
some new phrase in their passage, they embellish the
language and the text of their authors with an inconceivable
confusion of idioms. They might well be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
called the preservers of the instability of language
in the literature of the frontier provinces. Our ignorance
accepts, without appeal, the decisions of this
walking academy; and you have had occasion, at
times, to admire the energy and the grotesque Italian
of our poets, in the mouths of the singers of the
lagoons. It is noon on Sunday after Grand Mass, upon
the public place of Chioggia, or of an evening in the
cabarets on the banks, that these rhapsodists delight
a numerous and impassioned audience by their
recitations mingled with song and declamation. The
<i lang="it">cupido</i> usually stands upon a table, and plays from
time to time a symphony or finale after his fashion,
upon some kind of instrument; sometimes the
Calabrian pipe, sometimes the violin, flute, or guitar.
The Chioggiotes, cold and phlegmatic in appearance,
listen and smoke at first, with an imperturbable and
almost disdainful air; but at the noble battle of
Ariosto’s heroes, at the death of Paladins, the rescue
of ladies, and the defeat of giants, the audience are
aroused, become animated, utter cries, excite themselves
so effectually, that pipes and glasses fly into
pieces, the seats and the tables are overturned, and
often the <i lang="it">cupido</i>, about to fall the victim to the
enthusiasm he has called forth, is forced to take flight,
while the <i lang="it">dilettanti</i> spread themselves through the
country in pursuit of an imaginary ravisher with cries
of ‘<i lang="it">d’amazza! d’amazza!</i> kill the monster! kill the
coward! bravo, Astolphe! courage, brave comrade!’
It is thus these men of Chioggia, intoxicated with the
fumes of tobacco, wine, and poetry, take to their
boats, declaiming to the winds and waves broken
fragments of these delirious epic poems.</p>

<p>My windows look upon a garden, the west side of which is
bounded by the walls of a convent, while towards the east it

The garden is charmingly situated, but little frequented. It
is my custom every morning ... to spend a few moments at
the window ... to see the sun rise over the Adriatic.... I
recommend exactly this station, the most eligible one, perhaps,
in all Venice, to enjoy so splendid a prospect in perfection. A
purple twilight hangs over the deep, and a golden mist on
the lagoon announces the sun’s approach. The heavens and

PLEASANT MURANO<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I passed</span> in a gondola to pleasant Murano, distant
about a little mile from the citie, where they make
their delicate Venice glasses, so famous over al
Christendome for the incomparable finenes thereof,
and in one of their working houses made a glasse my
selfe. Most of their principall matter whereof they
make their glasses is a kinde of earth which is brought
thither by sea from Drepanum, a goodly haven towne
of Sicilie, where Æneas buried his aged father Anchises.
This Murano is a very delectable and populous
place, having many faire buildings both publique and
private, and divers very pleasant gardens. The first
that inhabited it were those of the towne Altinum,
bordering upon the sea coast, who in the time of the
Hunnes invasion of Italy, repaired hither with their
wives and children, for the securitie of their lives,
as other borderers also did at the same time to those
Islands, where Venice now standeth. Here did I eate
the best oysters that ever I did in all my life. They
were indeede but little, something lesse than our
Wainflete oysters about London.... By the way,
betwixt Venice and Murano I observed a most notable
thing, whereof I had often heard long before, a faire
monastery of Augustinian monkes built by a second
Flora or Lais. I meane a rich Cortezan of Venice,
whose name was Margarita Æmiliana. I have not
heard of so religious a worke done by so irreligious a
founder in any place of Christendome: belike she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>

<a id="p_172"></a>MURANO<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> decay of the city of Venice is, in many respects,
like that of an outwearied and aged human frame;
the cause of its decrepitude is indeed at the heart, but
the outward appearances of it are first at the extremities.
In the centre of the city there are still places
where some evidence of vitality remains, and where,
with kind closing of the eyes to signs, too manifest
even there, of distress and declining fortune, the
stranger may succeed in imagining, for a little while,
what must have been the aspect of Venice in her
prime. But this lingering pulsation has not force
enough any more to penetrate into the suburbs and
outskirts of the city; the frost of death has there
seized upon it irrevocably, and the grasp of mortal
disease is marked daily by the increasing breadth of
its belt of ruin. Nowhere is this seen more grievously
than along the great north-eastern boundary, once
occupied by the smaller palaces of the Venetians,
built for pleasure or repose; the nobler piles along
the Grand Canal being reserved for the pomp and
business of daily life. To such smaller palaces some
garden ground was commonly attached, opening to
the water-side; and, in front of these villas and
gardens, the lagoon was wont to be covered in the
evening by gondolas: the space of it between this
part of the city and the island group of Murano being
to Venice, in her time of power, what its parks are to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
London; only gondolas were used instead of carriages,
and the crowd of the population did not come out
till towards sunset, and prolonged their pleasures far
into the night, company answering to company with
alternate singing.</p>

<p>If, knowing this custom of the Venetians, and with
a vision in his mind of summer palaces lining the shore,
and myrtle gardens sloping to the sea, the traveller
now seeks this suburb of Venice, he will be strangely
and sadly surprised to find a new but perfectly desolate
quay, about a mile in length, extending from the
arsenal to the Sacca della Misericordia, in front of a
line of miserable houses built in the course of the last
sixty or eighty years, yet already tottering to their
ruin; and not less to find that the principal object
in the view which these houses (built partly in front
and partly on the ruins of the ancient palaces) now
command is a dead brick wall, about a quarter of a
mile across the water, interrupted only by a kind of
white lodge, the cheerfulness of which prospect is not
enhanced by his finding that this wall encloses the
principal public cemetery of Venice. He may, perhaps,
marvel for a few moments at the singular taste of the
old Venetians in taking their pleasure under a churchyard
wall; but on further inquiry, he will find that
the building on the island, like those on the shore, is
recent, that it stands on the ruins of the Church of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cristoforo della Pace; and that, with a singular,
because unintended, moral, the modern Venetians
have replaced the Peace of the Christ-bearer by the
Peace of Death, and where they once went, as the
sun set daily, to their pleasure, now go, as the sun
sets to each of them, for ever, to their graves.</p>

<p>Yet the power of Nature cannot be shortened by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
the folly, nor her beauty altogether saddened by the
misery, of man. The broad tides still ebb and flow
brightly about the island of the dead, and the linked
conclave of the Alps know no decline from their old
pre-eminence, nor stoop from their golden thrones
in the circle of the horizon. So lovely is the scene
still, in spite of all its injuries, that we shall find ourselves
drawn there again and again at evening out
of the narrow canals and streets of the city, to watch
the wreaths of the sea-mist weaving themselves like
mourning veils around the mountains far away, and
listen to the green waves as they fret and sigh along
the cemetery shore.</p>

<p>But it is morning now: we have a hard day’s work
to do at Murano, and our boat shoots swiftly from
beneath the last bridge of Venice, and brings us out
into the open sea and sky.</p>

<p>The pure cumuli of cloud lie crowded and leaning
against one another, rank beyond rank, far over the
shining water, each cut away at its foundation by a
level line, trenchant and clear, till they sink to the
horizon like a flight of marble steps, except where
the mountains meet them, and are lost in them, barred
across by the grey terraces of those cloud foundations
and reduced into one crestless bank of blue, spotted
here and there with strange flakes of wan, aerial
greenish light, strewed upon them like snow. And
underneath is the long dark line of the mainland
fringed with low trees; and then the wide-waving
surface of the burnished lagoon trembling slowly, and
shaking out into forked bands of lengthening fight the
images of the towers of cloud above. To the north,
there is first the great cemetery wall, then the long
stray buildings of Murano, and the island villages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
beyond, glittering in intense crystalline vermilion,
like so much jewellery scattered on a mirror, their
towers poised apparently in the air a little above the
horizon, and their reflections, as sharp and vivid and
substantial as themselves, thrown on the vacancy
between them and the sea. And thus the villages seem
standing on the air; and, to the east, there is a cluster
of ships that seem sailing on the land; for the sandy
line of the Lido stretches itself between us and them,
and we can see the tall white sails moving beyond it,
but not the sea, only there is a sense of the great sea
being indeed there, and a solemn strength of gleaming
light in the sky above.</p>

<p>The most discordant feature in the whole scene is
the cloud which hovers above the glass furnaces of
Murano; but this we may not regret, as it is one of
the last signs left of human exertion among the
ruinous villages which surround us. The silent gliding
of the gondola brings it nearer to us every moment;
we pass the cemetery, and a deep sea-channel which
separates it from Murano, and finally enter a narrow
water-street, with a paved footpath on each side,
raised three or four feet above the canal, and forming
a kind of quay between the water and the doors of
the houses. These latter are, for the most part, low,
but built with massy doors and windows of marble
or Istrian stone, square set, and barred with iron;
buildings evidently once of no mean order, though
now inhabited only by the poor. Here and there an
ogee window of the fourteenth century, or a doorway
deeply enriched with cable mouldings, shows itself
in the midst of more ordinary features; and several
houses, consisting of one story only carried on square
pillars, forming a short arcade along the quay, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
windows sustained on shafts, of red Verona marble,
of singular grace and delicacy. All now in vain: little
care is there for their delicacy or grace among the
rough fishermen sauntering on the quay with their
jackets hanging loose from their shoulders, jacket
and cap and hair all of the same dark-greenish sea-grey.
But there is some life in the scene more than
is usual in Venice; the women are sitting at their
doors knitting busily, and various workmen of the
glass-houses sifting glass-dust upon the pavement,
and strange cries coming from one side of the canal
to the other, and ringing far along the crowded water,
from vendors of figs and grapes, and gourds, and shellfish;
cries partly descriptive of the eatables in question,
but interspersed with others of a character
unintelligible in proportion to their violence, and
fortunately so, if we may judge by a sentence which
is stencilled in black, within a garland, on the whitewashed
walls of nearly every other house in the street,
but which, how often soever written, no one seems
to regard: ‘Bestemme non più. Lodate Gesù.’</p>

<p>We push our way on between large barges laden
with fresh water from Fusina, in round white tubs
seven feet across, and complicated boats full of all
manner of nets, that look as if they could never be
disentangled, hanging from their masts and over their
sides; and presently pass under a bridge with the
lion of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark on its archivolt, and another on a
pillar at the end of the parapet, a small red lion with
much of the puppy in his face, looking vacantly up
into the air (in passing we may note that, instead of
feathers, his wings are covered with hair, and in
several other points the manner of his sculpture is not
uninteresting). Presently the canal turns a little to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
the left, and thereupon becomes more quiet, the main
bustle of the water-street being usually confined to
the first straight reach of it, some quarter of a mile
long, the Cheapside of Murano. We pass a considerable
church on the left, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pietro, and a little square
opposite to it with a few acacia-trees, and then find
our boat suddenly seized by a strong green eddy, and
whirled into the tide-way of one of the main channels
of the lagoon, which divides the town of Murano into
two parts by a deep stream some fifty yards over,
crossed only by one wooden bridge. We let ourselves
drift some way down the current, looking at the low
line of cottages on the other side of it, hardly knowing
if there be more cheerfulness or melancholy in the
way the sunshine glows on their ruinous but whitewashed
walls, and sparkles on the rushing of the green
water by the grass-grown quay. It needs a strong
stroke of the oar to bring us into the mouth of another
quiet canal on the farther side of the tide-way, and
we are still somewhat giddy when we run the head of
the gondola into the sand on the left-hand side of
this more sluggish stream, and land under the seat
end of the Church of San Donato, the ‘Matrice’ or
‘Mother’ Church of Murano.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I was</span> lately to see the arsenal of Venice, one of
the worthiest things of Christendom; they say there
are as many galleys, and galeasses of all sorts, belonging
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, either in cours, as anchor, in dock,
or upon the carine, as there be days in the year; here
they can build a complete galley in half a day, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
put her afloat in perfect equipage, having all the
ingredients fitted beforehand, as they did in three
hours, when Henry the Third passed this way to
France from Poland, who wished, that besides Paris
and his parliament towns, he had this arsenal in
exchange for three of his chiefest cities. There are
three hundred people perpetually here at work, and
if one comes young and grows old in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s
service, he hath a pension from the State during life.
Being brought to see one of the Clarissimos that governs
this arsenal, this huge sea store-house, amongst other
matters reflecting upon England, he was saying: ‘That
if Cavalier Don Roberto Mansell were now here, he
thought verily the republic would make a proffer to
him to be admiral of that fleet of galleys and galleons,
which are now going against the Duke of Ossuna and
the forces of Naples, you are so well known here.’</p>

<p>I was, since I came hither, in Murano, a little island
about the distance of Lambeth from London, where
crystal glass is made, and it is a rare sight to see a
whole street, where on the one side there are twenty
furnaces together at work. They say here that although
one should transplant a glass-furnace from Murano
to Venice herself, or to any of the little assembly of
islands about her, or to any other part of the earth
besides, and use the same materials, the same workmen,
the same fuel, the self-same ingredients every
day, yet they cannot make crystal glass in that perfection,
for beauty and lustre, as in Murano. Some
impute it to the quality of the circumambient air that
hangs over the place, which is purified and attenuated
by the concurrence of so many fires that are in those
furnaces night and day perpetually, for they are
like the vestal fire which never goes out....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
The art of glass-making here is very highly valued;
for, whosoever be of that profession are gentlemen
<i lang="la">ipso facto</i>, and it is not without reason; it being a
rare kind of knowledge and chemistry to transmute
dust and sand (for they are the only main ingredients)
to such a diaphanous pellucid dainty body as you see
a crystal glass is, which hath this property above
gold or silver or any other mineral, to admit no poison;
as also that it never wastes or loses a whit of its first
weight, though you use it never so long. When I
saw so many sorts of curious glasses made here
I thought upon the compliment which a gentleman
put upon a lady in England, who having five or six
comely daughters, said he never saw in his life such
a dainty cupboard of crystal glasses; the compliment
proceeds, it seems, from a saying they have here,
‘That the first handsome woman that ever was made,
was made of Venice glass,’ which implies beauty, but
brittleness with all (and Venice is not unfurnished
with some of that mould, for no place abounds more
with lasses and glasses).... When I pried into the
materials, and observed the furnaces and the calcinations,
the transubstantiations, the liquefactions that
are incident to this art, my thoughts were raised to
a higher speculation: that if this small furnace-fire
hath the virtue to convert such a small lump of dark
dust and sand into such a precious clear body as
crystal, surely that grand universal fire which shall
happen at the day of judgment, may by its violent
ardour vitrify and turn to one lump of crystal the
whole body of the earth; nor am I the first that fell
upon this conceit.</p>

TORCELLO<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Seven</span> miles to the north of Venice, the banks of
sand, which nearer the city rise little above low-water
mark, attain by degrees a higher level, and knit themselves
at last into fields of salt morass, raised here and
there into shapeless mounds, and intercepted by narrow
creeks of sea. One of the feeblest of these inlets,
after winding for some time among buried fragments
of masonry, and knots of sunburnt weeds whitened
with webs of fucus, stays itself in an utterly stagnant
pool beside a plot of greener grass covered with ground
ivy and violets. On this mound is built a rude brick
campanile, of the commonest Lombardic type, which
if we ascend towards evening (and there are none to
hinder us, the door of its ruinous staircase swinging
idly on its hinges), we may command from it one of
the most notable scenes in this wide world of ours.
Far as the eye can reach, a waste of wild sea moor,
of a lurid ashen grey; not like our northern moors
with their jet-black pools and purple heath, but
lifeless, the colour of sackcloth, with the corrupted
sea-water soaking through the roots of its acrid weeds,
and gleaming hither and thither through its snaky
channels. No gathering of fantastic mists, nor coursing
of clouds across it; but melancholy clearness of space
in the warm sunset, oppressive, reaching to the
horizon of its level gloom. To the very horizon, on the
north-east; but, to the north and west, there is a blue
line of higher land along the border of it, and above
this, but further back, a misty band of mountains,
touched with snow. To the east, the paleness and roar
of the Adriatic, louder at momentary intervals as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
the surf breaks on the bars of sand; to the south, the
widening branches of the calm lagoon, alternately
purple and pale green, as they reflect the evening
clouds or twilight sky; and almost beneath our feet,
on the same field which sustains the tower we gaze
from, a group of four buildings, two of them little
larger than cottages (though built of stone, and one
adorned by a quaint belfry), the third an octagonal
chapel, of which we can see but little more than the
flat red roof with its rayed tiling, the fourth, a considerable
church with nave and aisles, but of which,
in like manner, we can see little but the long central
ridge and lateral slopes of roof, which the sunlight
separates in one glowing mass from the green field
beneath and grey moor beyond. There are no living
creatures near the buildings, nor any vestige of village
or city round about them. They lie like a little company
of ships becalmed on a far-away sea.</p>

<p>Then look farther to the south. Beyond the widening
branches of the lagoon, and rising out of the bright
lake into which they gather, there are a multitude of
towers, dark, and scattered among square-set shapes
of clustered palaces, a long and irregular line fretting
the southern sky.</p>

<p>Mother and daughter, you behold them both in
their widowhood,—<span class="smcap">Torcello</span> and <span class="smcap">Venice</span>.</p>

<p>Thirteen hundred years ago, the grey moorland
looked as it does this day, and the purple mountains
stood as radiantly in the deep distances of evening;
but on the line of the horizon, there were strange
fires mixed with the light of sunset, and the lament
of many human voices mixed with the fretting of
the waves on their ridges of sand. The flames rose
from the ruins of Altinum; the lament from the multitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
of its people, seeking, like Israel of old, a refuge
from the sword in the paths of the sea.</p>

<p>The cattle are feeding and resting upon the site of
the city that they left; the mower’s scythe swept this
day at dawn over the chief street of the city that
they built, and the swathes of soft grass are now
sending up their scent into the night air, the only
incense that fills the temple of their ancient worship.
Let us go down into that little space of meadow land.</p>

<p>The inlet which runs nearest to the base of the
campanile is not that by which Torcello is commonly
approached. Another, somewhat broader, and overhung
by alder copse, winds out of the main channel
of the lagoon up to the very edge of the little meadow
which was once the piazza of the city, and there, stayed
by a few grey stones which present some semblance
of a quay, forms its boundary at one extremity.
Hardly larger than an ordinary English farmyard,
and roughly enclosed on each side by broken palings
and hedges of honeysuckle and briar, the narrow
field retires from the water’s edge, traversed by a
scarcely traceable footpath, for some forty or fifty
paces, and then expanding into the form of a small
square, with buildings on three sides of it, the fourth
being that which opens to the water. Two of these,
that on our left and that in front of us as we approach
from the canal, are so small that they might well be
taken for the outhouses of the farm, though the first
is a conventual building, and the other aspires to the
title of the ‘Palazzo publico,’ both dating as far back
as the beginning of the fourteenth century; the third,
the octagonal church of Santa Fosca, is far more
ancient than either, yet hardly on a larger scale.
Though the pillars of the portico which surrounds it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
are of pure Greek marble, and their capitals are enriched
with delicate sculpture, they, and the arches
they sustain, together only raise the roof to the height
of a cattle-shed; and the first strong impression which
the spectator receives from the whole scene is, that
whatever sin it may have been which has on this spot
been visited with so utter a desolation, it could not
at least have been ambition. Nor will this impression
be diminished as we approach, or enter, the larger
church, to which the whole group of building is subordinate.
It has evidently been built by men in flight
and distress, who sought in the hurried erection of
their island church such a shelter for their earnest
and sorrowful worship as, on the one hand, could not
attract the eyes of their enemies by its splendour, and
yet, on the other, might not awaken too bitter feelings
by its contrast with the churches which they had seen
destroyed. There is visible everywhere a simple and
tender effort to recover some of the form of the temples
which they had loved, and to do honour to God by
that which they were erecting, while distress and
humiliation prevented the desire, and prudence precluded
the admission, either of luxury of ornament or
magnificence of plan. The exterior is absolutely
devoid of decoration, with the exception only of the
western entrance and the lateral door, of which the
former has carved sideposts and architrave, and the
latter, crosses of rich sculpture; while the massy
stone shutters of the windows, turning on huge rings
of stone, which answer the double purpose of stanchions
and brackets, cause the whole building rather to
resemble a refuge from Alpine storm than the cathedral
of a populous city; and, internally, the two
solemn mosaics of the eastern and western extremities,—one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
representing the Last Judgment, the other the
Madonna, her tears falling as her hands are raised to
bless,—and the noble range of pillars which enclose
the space between, terminated by the high throne
for the pastor and the semicircular raised seats for
the superior clergy, are expressive at once of the deep
sorrow and the sacred courage of men who had no
home left them upon earth, but who looked for one to
come, of men ‘persecuted but not forsaken, cast down
but not destroyed.’ ...</p>

<p>And if the stranger would yet learn in what spirit
it was that the dominion of Venice was begun, and in
what strength she went forth conquering and to conquer,
let him not seek to estimate the wealth of her
arsenals or number of her armies, nor look upon the
pageantry of her palaces, nor enter into the secrets
of her councils; but let him ascend the highest tier
of the stern ledges that sweep round the altar of
Torcello, and then, looking as the pilot did of old along
the marble ribs of the goodly temple-ship, let him
repeople its veined deck with the shadows of its dead
mariners, and strive to feel in himself the strength of
heart that was kindled within them, when first, after
the pillars of it had settled in the sand, and the roof
of it had been closed against the angry sky that was
still reddened by the fires of their homesteads,—first,
within the shelter of its knitted walls, amidst the
murmur of the waste of waves and the beating of the
wings of the sea-birds round the rock that was strange
to them,—rose that ancient hymn, in the power of
their gathered voices:</p>

<a id="p_188"></a>SAN FRANCESCO DELLA VIGNA<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Do</span> you know San Francesco della Vigna, in Venice?</p>

<p>Some say that its tall tower is the first point rising
above the waves, which the returning Venetian sailor
sees as he comes homeward from the south-east, over
the foaming bars of Chioggia and Malamocco, one
slender shaft lifted against sky, calling him back to
his city and his home. All the mariners and fishermen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
who come and go over the Adrian waters,
have an especial tenderness, an especial reverence,
for Saint Francis of the Vineyard. There is no vineyard
now; only one small square garden, with a
cloister running round it, arched, columned, marble
paved, where the dead lie under the worn smooth
slabs, and the box-edges hem in thyme, and balsams,
and basil, and carnations, and thrift, and saxifrage,
and other homely hardy plants which need slight
fostering care. The sea winds blow strongly there,
and the sea fogs drift thickly, and the steam and
smoke of the foundries round about hang in heavy
clouds, where once the pavilions and the lawns and
the terraces of the patricians of Venice touched the
grey-green lagoon; but this garden of San Francesco
is still sweet and fresh: shut in between its marble
colonnades with the deep brown shadow of the
church leaning over it, and the chiming of the bells,
and the melody of the organ rolling above it in deep
waves of sound, jarred sometimes by the clash of
the hammers falling on the iron and the copper of
the foundries near at hand, and sometimes sinking
to a sweet silence, only softly stirred by the splash of
an oar as a boat passes up or down the narrow canal.</p>

<p>For the sake of that cloistered garden, a gondola
came one summer every day to the landing-place
before San Francesco. In the gondola was an artist,
a painter of Paris, Yvon Dorât, who had seen the spot,
and liked it, and returned to paint from it every day,
finding an inexpressible charm in its contrasts of
gloom and light, of high brown walls and low-lying
graves, of fresh green herbs and flowers, and melancholy
immemorial marble aisles. He meant to make
a great picture of it, with the ethereal Venetian sky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
above all, and, between the straight edges of the
bay, a solitary monk passing thoughtfully. Dorât
was under the charm of Venice: that subtle dreamy
charm, voluptuous and yet spiritual, which no
artist or poet ever can resist, and these summer
months were to him as a vision of languor, and
beauty and rest, in which the white wings of sea-birds,
and the silver of gleaming waters, and the
festal figures of Carpaccio and the golden warmth of
Palma, Vecchio, and the glories of sunsets aflame
behind the Euganean hills, and the mystery of moonless
night, with the tide washing against the weed-grown
piles of a Madonna of the lagoon, were all
blended in that confusion of past and present, of art
and nature, of desire and repose, which fills the soul
and the senses of those who love Venice, and live
in thrall to her.</p>

<a id="p_193"></a>TO CHIOGGIA WITH OAR AND SAIL<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> <dfn>sandolo</dfn> is a boat shaped like the gondola, but
smaller and lighter, without benches, and without
the high steel prow or ferro which distinguishes the
gondola. The gunwale is only just raised above the
water, over which the little craft skims with a rapid
bounding motion, affording an agreeable variation
from the stately swanlike movement of the gondola.
In one of these boats—called by him the <dfn>Fisolo</dfn> or
<dfn>Seamew</dfn>—my friend Eustace had started with Antonio,
intending to row the whole way to Chioggia,
or, if the breeze favoured, to hoist a sail and help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
himself along. After breakfast, when the crew for
my gondola had been assembled, Francesco and I
followed with the Signora. It was one of those perfect
mornings which occur as a respite from broken
weather, when the air is windless and the light falls
soft through haze on the horizon. As we broke into
the lagoon behind the Redentore, the islands in front
of us, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Spirito, Poveglia, Malamocco, seemed as
though they were just lifted from the sea-line. The
Euganeans, far away to westward, were bathed in
mist, and almost blent with the blue sky. Our four
rowers put their backs into their work; and soon we
reached the port of Malamocco, where a breeze from
the Adriatic caught us sideways for a while....</p>

<p>Now we are well lost in the lagoons—Venice no
longer visible behind; the Alps and Euganeans
shrouded in a noonday haze; the lowlands at the
mouth of Brenta marked by clumps of trees ephemerally
faint in silver silhouette against the filmy,
shimmering horizon. Form and colour have disappeared
in light irradiated vapour of an opal hue.
And yet instinctively we know that we are not at
sea; the different quality of the water, the piles
emerging here and there above the surface, the suggestion
of coastlines scarcely felt in this infinity of
lustre, all remind us that our voyage is confined to
the charmed limits of an inland lake. At length the
jutting headland of Pelestrina was reached. We
broke across the Porto di Chioggia, and saw Chioggia
itself ahead—a huddled mass of houses low upon the
water. One by one, as we rowed steadily, the fishing-boats
passed by, emerging from their harbour for a
twelve hours’ cruise upon the open sea. In a long
line they came, with variegated sails of orange, red,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
and saffron, curiously chequered at the corners, and
cantled with devices in contrasted tints. A little
land-breeze carried them forward. The lagoon
reflected their deep colours till they reached the port.
Then, slightly swerving eastward on their course, but
still in single file, they took the sea and scattered,
like beautiful bright-plumaged birds, who from a
streamlet float into a lake, and find their way at
large according as each wills.</p>

<p>The Signorino and Antonio, though want of wind
obliged them to row the whole way from Venice, had
reached Chioggia an hour before, and stood waiting
to receive us on the quay. It is a quaint town this
Chioggia, which has always lived a separate life from
that of Venice. Language and race and customs have
held the two populations apart from these distant
years when Genoa and the Republic of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark
fought their duel to the death out in the Chioggian
harbours, down to these days, when your Venetian
gondolier will tell you that the Chioggoto loves his
pipe more than his <i lang="it">donna</i> or his wife. The main
canal is lined with substantial palaces, attesting to
old wealth and comfort. But from Chioggia, even
more than from Venice, the tide of modern luxury
and traffic has retreated. The place is left to fishing
folk and builders of the fishing craft, whose wharves
still form the liveliest quarter. Wandering about its
wide deserted courts and <i lang="it">calli</i>, we feel the spirit of
the decadent Venetian nobility....</p>

<p>That afternoon the gondola and sandolo were
lashed together side by side. Two sails were raised,
and in this lazy fashion we stole homewards, faster
or slower according as the breeze freshened or slackened,
landing now and then on islands, sauntering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
along the sea-walls which bulwark Venice from the
Adriatic, and singing—those at least of us who had
the power to sing. Four of our Venetians had trained
voices and memories of inexhaustible music. Over
the level water, with the ripple plashing at our keel,
their songs went abroad, and mingled with the failing
day. The barcaroles and serenades peculiar to Venice
were, of course, in harmony with the occasion. But
some transcripts from classical operas were even more
attractive, through the dignity with which these men
invested them. By the peculiarity of their treatment
the <i lang="it">recitativo</i> of the stage assumed a solemn movement,
marked in rhythm, which removed it from the
commonplace into antiquity, and made me understand
how cultivated music may pass back by natural,
unconscious transition into the realm of popular
melody.</p>

<p>The sun sank, not splendidly, but quietly in banks
of clouds above the Alps. Stars came out, uncertainly
at first, and then in strength, reflected on the sea.
The men of the Dogana watch-boat challenged us
and let us pass. Madonna’s lamp was twinkling from
her shrine upon the harbour-pile. The city grew
before us. Stealing into Venice in that calm—stealing
silently and shadowlike, with scarce a ruffle of the
water, the masses of the town emerging out of darkness
into twilight, till San Giorgio’s gun boomed with
a flash athwart our stern, and the gas-lamps of the
Piazzetta swam into sight; all this was like a long
enchanted chapter of romance. And now the music
of our men had sunk to one faint whistling from
Eustace of tunes in harmony with the whispers at
the prow.</p>

<p>Then came the steps of the Palazzo Venier and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
deep-scented darkness of the garden. As we passed
through to supper, I plucked a spray of yellow
Banksia rose, and put it in my buttonhole. The dew
was on its burnished leaves, and evening had drawn
forth its perfume.</p>

<a id="p_197"></a>THE MIRROR OF THE LAGOON<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> strange, soft sea, so tempered into gentlehood,
brings through its quietude another element of
charm into Venice. It reflects all things with a wonderful
perfection. Whatever loveliness is by its side
it makes more lovely. Shallow itself, it seems deep;
and the towers and palaces of Venice in all their
colours descend and shine among other clouds and
in another sky below. All outlines of sculpture and
architecture, of embossment, in wall and window;
all play of sunshine and shade; all the human life
in balcony, bridge or quay, on barge or boat, are in
the waters as in a silent dream—revealed in every
line and colour, but with an exquisite difference in
softness and purity. All Nature’s doings in the sky
are also repeated with a tender fidelity in the mirror
of the lagoon—morning light, noonday silver, purple
thunder-cloud in the afternoon, sunset vapours, the
moon and stars of night—and not only on the surface,
but also, it seems, in an immeasurable depth. To
look over the side of the boat into the water is to
cry, ‘I see infinite space.’</p>

<a id="p_198"></a>ON THE LAGOONS<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> afternoons invite us to a further flight upon the
water. Both sandolo and gondola await our choice,
and we may sail or row, according as the wind and
inclination tempt us.</p>

<p>Yonder lies San Luzzaro, with the neat red buildings
of the Armenian convent. The last oleander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
blossoms shine rosy pink above its walls against the
pure blue sky as we glide into the little harbour.
Boats piled with coal-black grapes block the landing-place,
for the Padri are gathering their vintage from
the Lido, and their presses run with new wine.
Eustace and I have not come to revive memories of
Byron—that curious patron-saint of the Armenian
colony—or to inspect the printing-press, which issues
books of little value for our studies. It is enough to
pace the terrace, and linger half an hour beneath the
low broad arches of the alleys pleached with vines,
through which the domes and towers of Venice rise
more beautiful by distance.</p>

<p>Malamocco lies considerably farther, and needs a
full hour of stout rowing to reach it. Alighting there,
we cross the narrow strip of land, and find ourselves
upon the huge sea-wall—block piled on block—of
Istrian stone in tiers and ranks, with cunning breathing-places
for the waves to wreak their fury on and
foam their force away in fretful waste. The very
existence of Venice may be said to depend sometimes
on these <i lang="it">murazzi</i>, which were finished at an immense
cost by the Republic in the days of its decadence.
The enormous monoliths which compose them had to
be brought across the Adriatic in sailing vessels. Of
all the Lidi, that of Malamocco is the weakest; and
here, if anywhere, the sea might effect an entrance
into the lagoon. Our gondoliers told us of some
places where the <i lang="it">murazzi</i> were broken in a gale, or
<i lang="it">sciroccale</i>, not very long ago. Lying awake in Venice,
when the wind blows hard, one hears the sea thundering
upon its sandy barrier, and blesses God for the
<i lang="it">murazzi</i>. On such a night it happened once to me to
dream a dream of Venice overwhelmed by water. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
saw the billows roll across the smooth lagoon, like a
gigantic Eager. The Ducal Palace crumbled, and
San Marco’s domes went down. The Campanile
rocked and shivered like a reed. And all along the
Grand Canal the palaces swayed helpless, tottering to
their fall, while boats piled high with men and women
strove to stem the tide, and save themselves from
those impending ruins. It was a mad dream, born of
the sea’s roar and Tintoretto’s painting. But this
afternoon no such visions are suggested. The sea
sleeps, and in the moist autumn air we break tall
branches of the seeded yellowing samphire from
hollows of the rocks, and bear them homeward
in a wayward bouquet mixed with cobs of Indian-corn.</p>

<p>Fusina is another point for these excursions. It
lies at the mouth of the Canal di Brenta, where the
mainland ends in marsh and meadows, intersected by
broad renes. In spring the ditches bloom with fleurs-de-lys;
in autumn they take sober colouring from
lilac daisies and the delicate sea-lavender. Scores of
tiny plants are turning scarlet on the brown moist
earth; and when the sun goes down behind the
Euganean hills, his crimson canopy of cloud, reflected
on these shallows, muddy shoals, and wilderness of
matted weeds, converts the common earth into a fairyland
of fabulous dyes. Purple, violet, and rose are
spread around us. In front stretches the lagoon,
tinted with a pale light from the east, and beyond this
pallid mirror shines Venice—a long low broken line,
touched with the softest roseate flush. Ere we reach
the Giudecca on our homeward way, sunset has
faded. The western skies have clad themselves in
green, barred with dark fire-rimmed clouds. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Euganean hills stand like stupendous pyramids,
Egyptian, solemn, against a lemon space on the horizon.
The far reaches of the lagoons, the Alps, and
islands assume those tones of glowing lilac which are
the supreme beauty of Venetian evening. Then, at
last, we see the first lamps glitter on the Zattere.
The quiet of the night has come.</p>

<p>Words cannot be formed to express the endless
varieties of Venetian sunset. The most magnificent
follow after wet stormy days, when the west breaks
suddenly into a labyrinth of fire, when chasms of clear
turquoise heavens emerge, and horns of flame are
flashed to the zenith, and unexpected splendours
scale the fretted clouds, step over step, stealing along
the purple caverns till the whole dome throbs. Or,
again, after a fair day, a change of weather
approaches, and high, infinitely high, the skies are
woven over with a web of half-transparent cirrus-clouds.
These in the afterglow blush crimson, and
through their rifts the depth of heaven is of a hard
and gemlike blue, and all the water turns to rose
beneath them. I remember one such evening on the
way back from Torcello. We were well out at sea
between Mazzorbo and Murano. The ruddy arches
overhead were reflected without interruption in the
waveless ruddy lake below. Our black boat was the
only dark spot in this sphere of splendour. We
seemed to hang suspended; and such as this, I
fancied, must be the feeling of an insect caught in
the heart of a fiery-petalled rose. Yet not these
melodramatic sunsets alone are beautiful. Even more
exquisite, perhaps, are the lagoons, painted in monochrome
of greys, with just one touch of pink upon
a western cloud, scattered in ripples here and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
on the waves below, reminding us that day has passed
and evening come. And beautiful again are the calm
settings of fair weather, when sea and sky alike are
cheerful, and the topmost blades of the lagoon grass,
peeping from the shallows, glance like emeralds upon
the surface. There is no deep stirring of the spirit
in a symphony of light and colour; but purity, peace,
and freshness make their way into our hearts.</p>

<h3 class="break">
<a id="p_202"></a>AT THE LIDO<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Of</span> all these afternoon excursions, that to the Lido
is most frequent. It has two points for approach.
The more distant is the little station of San Nicoletto,
at the mouth of the Porto. With an ebb-tide, the
water of the lagoon runs past the mulberry gardens
of this hamlet like a river. There is here a grove of
acacia-trees, shadowy and dreamy, above deep grass,
which even an Italian summer does not wither. The
Riva is fairly broad, forming a promenade, where one
may conjure up the personages of a century ago.
For San Nicoletto used to be a fashionable resort
before the other points of Lido had been occupied by
pleasure-seekers. An artist even now will select its
old-world quiet, leafy shade, and prospect through
the islands of Vignole and Sant’ Erasmo to snow-touched
peaks of Antelao and Tofana, rather than the
glare and bustle and extended view of Venice which
its rival Sant’ Elisabetta offers.</p>

<p>But when we want a plunge into the Adriatic, or a
stroll along smooth sands, or a breath of genuine
sea-breeze, or a handful of horned poppies from the
dunes, or a lazy half-hour’s contemplation of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
limitless horizon flecked with russet sails, then we seek
Sant’ Elisabetta. Our boat is left at the landing-place.
We saunter across the island and back again.
Antonio and Francesco wait and order wine, which
we drink with them in the shade of the little <i lang="it">osteria’s</i>
wall.</p>

<p>A certain afternoon in May I well remember, for
this visit to Lido was marked by one of those
apparitions which are as rare as they are welcome to
the artist’s soul. I have always held that in our
modern life the only real equivalent for the antique
mythopœic sense—that sense which enabled the
Hellenic race to figure for themselves the powers of
earth and air, streams and forests, and the presiding
genii of places, under the forms of living human
beings, is supplied by the appearance at some felicitous
moment of a man or woman who impersonates
for our imagination the essence of the beauty that
environs us. It seems, at such a fortunate moment,
as though we had been waiting for this revelation,
although perchance the want of it had not been previously
felt. Our sensations and perceptions test
themselves at the touchstone of this living individuality.
The keynote of the whole music dimly sounding
in our ears is struck. A melody emerges, clear in
form and excellent in rhythm. The landscapes we
have painted on our brain no longer lack their central
figure. The life proper to the complex conditions we
have studied is discovered, and every detail judged
by this standard of vitality, falls into its right
relations.</p>

<p>I had been musing long that day and earnestly
upon the mystery of the lagoons, their opaline transparencies
of air and water, their fretful risings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
sudden subsidence into calm, the treacherousness of
their shoals, the sparkle and the splendour of their
sunlight. I had asked myself how would a Greek
sculptor have personified the elemental deity of these
salt-water lakes, so different in quality from the
Ægean or Ionian sea? What would he find distinctive
of their spirit? The Tritons of these shallows
must be of other form and lineage than the fierce-eyed
youth who blows his conch upon the curled
crest of a wave, crying aloud to his comrades, as he
bears the nymph away to caverns where the billows
plunge in tideless instability.</p>

<p>We had picked up shells and looked for sea-horses
on the Adriatic shore. Then we returned to give our
boatmen wine beneath the vine-clad <i lang="it">pergola</i>. Four
other men were there, drinking, and eating from a
dish of fried fish set upon the coarse white linen cloth.
Two of them soon rose and went away. Of the two
who stayed, one was a large, middle-aged man; the
other was still young. He was tall and sinewy, but
slender, for these Venetians are rarely massive in their
strength. Each limb is equally developed by the
exercise of rowing upright, bending all the muscles to
their stroke. Their bodies are elastically supple, with
free sway from the hips and a mercurial poise upon
the ankle. Stefano showed these qualities almost in
exaggeration. The type in him was refined to its
artistic perfection. Moreover, he was rarely in repose,
but moved with a singular brusque grace. A black
broad-brimmed hat was thrown back upon his matted
<i lang="it">zazzera</i> of dark hair tipped with dusky brown. This
shock of hair, cut in flakes, and falling wilfully,
reminded me of the lagoon grass when it darkens in
autumn upon uncovered shoals, and sunset gilds its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
sombre edges. Fiery grey eyes beneath it gazed
intensely, with compulsive effluence of electricity.
It was the wild glance of a Triton. Short blonde
moustache, dazzling teeth, skin bronzed, but showing
white and healthful through open front and sleeves
of lilac shirt. The dashing sparkle of this animate
splendour, who looked to me as though the sea-waves
and the sun had made him in some hour of secret and
unquiet rapture, was somehow emphasized by a
curious dint dividing his square chin—a cleft that
harmonized with smile on lip and steady flame in
eyes. I hardly know what effect it would have upon
a reader to compare eyes to opals. Yet Stefano’s
eyes, as they met mine, had the vitreous intensity
of opals, as though the colour of Venetian waters
were vitalized in them. This noticeable being had a
rough, hoarse voice, which, to develop the parallel
with a sea-god, might have screamed in storm or
whispered raucous messages from crests of tossing
billows.</p>

<p>I felt, as I looked, that here, for me at least, the
mythopoem of the lagoons was humanized; the spirit
of the salt-water lakes had appeared to me; the final
touch of life emergent from nature had been given;
I was satisfied; for I had seen a poem.</p>

<p>Then we rose, and wandered through the Jews’
cemetery. It is a quiet place, where the flat gravestones,
inscribed in Hebrew and Italian, lie deep in
Lido sand, waved over with wild grass and poppies.
I would fain believe that no neglect, but rather the
fashion of this folk, had left the monuments of
generations to be thus resumed by nature. Yet,
knowing nothing of the history of this burial-ground,
I dare not affirm so much. There is one outlying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
piece of the cemetery which seems to contradict my
charitable interpretation. It is not far from San
Nicoletto. No enclosure marks it from the unconsecrated
dunes. Acacia-trees sprout amid the monuments,
and break the tablets with their thorny shoots

<a id="p_206"></a>THE LIDO<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Yesterday</span> I set out early with my tutelary genius
for the Lido, the tongue of land which shuts in the
lagoons, and divides them from the sea. We landed
and walked straight across the isthmus. I heard a
loud hollow murmur,—it was the sea! I soon saw
it: it crested high against the shore, as it retired,—it
was about noon, and time of ebb. I have then seen
the sea with my own eyes, and followed it on its
beautiful bed, just as it quitted it. I wished the
children had been there to gather the shells; childlike,
I myself picked up plenty of them.... On the
Lido, not far from the sea, is the burial-place of
Englishmen, and a little further on, of the Jews:
both alike are refused the privilege of resting in consecrated
ground. I found here the tomb of Smith,
the noble English consul, and that of his first wife.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
It is to him that I owe my first copy of Palladio;
I thanked him for it here in his unconsecrated
grave....</p>

<p>The Lido is at best but a sand-bank. But the sea—it
is a grand sight! I will try and get a sail upon
it some day in a fishing-boat: the gondolas never
venture out so far....</p>

<p>A delicious day from morning to night! I have
been towards Chioggia, as far as Pelestrina, where
are the great structures, called <i lang="it">murazzi</i>, which
the Republic has caused to be raised against the
sea. They are hewn of stone, and properly are
intended to protect from the fury of the wild
element the Lido, which separates the lagoons from
the sea.</p>

<p>The lagoons are the work of old nature. First of
all, the land and tide, the ebb and flow, working
against each other, and then the gradual sinking of
the primal waters, were, together, the causes why,
at the upper end of the Adriatic, we find a pretty
extensive range of marshes, which, covered by the
flood-tide, are partly left bare by the ebb. Art took
possession of the highest spots, and thus arose Venice,
formed out of a group of a hundred isles, and surrounded
by hundreds more. Moreover, at an incredible
expense of money and labour, deep canals
have been dug through the marshes, in order that
at the time of high water, ships of war might pass
to the chief points. What human industry and wit
contrived and executed of old, skill and industry
must now keep up....</p>

<p>Yesterday evening I ascended the tower of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Mark’s: as I had lately seen from its top the lagoons
in their glory at flood-time, I wished to see them at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
low water; for in order to have a correct idea of the
place, it is necessary to take in both views. It looks
rather strange to see land all around one, where a
little before the eye fell upon a mirror of waters.
The islands are no longer islands—merely higher and
house-crowned spots in one large morass of a grey-greenish
colour, and intersected by beautiful canals.</p>

<a id="p_211"></a>LORD BYRON ON THE LIDO<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Lord Byron</span> (writes the poet’s friend) proposed to
me to accompany him in his rides on the Lido....
Every day that the weather would permit, Lord
Byron called for me in his gondola, and we found the
horses waiting for us outside the fort. We rode as far
as we could along the sea-shore, and then on a kind
of dyke, or embankment, which has been raised where
the island was very narrow, as far as another small
fort, about half-way between the principal one and
the town or village of Malamocco, near the other
extremity of the island,—the distance being about
three miles.</p>

<p>On the land side of the embankment, near the
smaller fort, was a boundary stone, which probably
marked some division of property,—all the side of
the island, nearest the lagoon, being divided into
gardens for the cultivation of vegetables. At the foot
of this stone, Lord Byron repeatedly told me that I
should cause him to be interred, if he should die in
Venice, or its neighbourhood. During my residence
here ... nothing could be more delightful than these
rides on the Lido. We were from half to three-quarters
of an hour crossing the water, during which his conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
was most amusing and interesting. Sometimes
he would bring with him any new book he had
received, and read to me the passages which struck
him most. Often he would repeat to me whole stanzas
of the poems he was writing, as he had composed
them on the preceding evening.</p>

<a id="p_214"></a>AN ISLAND VISIT<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I am</span> just returned from visiting the isles of Murano,
Torcello, and Mazorbo, distant about five miles from
Venice. To these amphibious spots the Romans,
inhabitants of eastern Lombardy, fled from the
rapine of Attila; and, if we may believe Cassiodorus,
there was a time when they presented a beautiful
appearance. Beyond them, on the coast of the
lagoons, rose the once populous city of Altina, with
its six stately gates, which Dandolo mentions. Its
neighbourhood was scattered with innumerable villas
and temples, composing altogether a prospect which
Martial compares to Baiæ: ‘Æmula Baiunis Altini
littora villis.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>But this agreeable scene, like so many others, is
passed entirely away, and has left nothing, except
heaps of stones and misshapen fragments, to vouch
for its former magnificence. Two of the islands, Costanziaco
and Amiano, that are imagined to have
contained the bowers and gardens of the Altinatians,
have sunk beneath the waters; those which remain
are scarcely worthy to rise above their surface.</p>

<p>Though I was persuaded little was left to be seen
above ground, I could not deny myself the imaginary
pleasure of treading a corner of the earth once so
adorned and cultivated; and of walking over the
roofs, perhaps, of concealed halls and undiscovered
palaces. Hiring, therefore, a <i lang="it">peiotte</i>, we took some
provisions and music (to us equally necessaries of
life), and launched into the canal, between <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael
and Murano.</p>

<p>The waves coursed each other with violence, and
dark clouds hung over the grand sweep of northern
mountains, whilst the west smiled with azure and
bright sunshine. Thunder rolled awfully at a distance,
and those white and greyish birds, the harbingers of
storms, flitted frequently before our bark. For some
moments we were in doubt whether to proceed; but
as we advanced by a little dome in the Isle of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael, shaped like an ancient temple, the sky
cleared, and the ocean subsiding by degrees, soon
presented a tranquil expanse, across which we were
smoothly wafted. Our instruments played several
delightful airs, that called forth the inhabitants of
every island, and held them silent, as if spellbound,
on the edge of their quays and terraces, till we were
out of hearing.</p>

<p>Leaving Murano far behind, Venice and its world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
of turrets began to sink on the horizon, and the low
desert isles beyond Mazorbo to lie stretched out before
us. Now we beheld vast wastes of purple flowers,
and could distinguish the low hum of the insects
which hover above them; such was the silence of the
place. Coasting these solitary fields, we wound
amongst several serpentine canals, bordered by
gardens of figs and pomegranates, with neat Indian-looking
inclosures of cane and reed: an aromatic
plant clothes the margin of the waters, which the
people justly dignify with the title of marine incense.
It proved very serviceable in subduing a musky odour,
which attacked us the moment we landed, and which
proceeds from serpents that lurk in the hedges.
These animals, say the gondoliers, defend immense
treasures which lie buried under the ruins. Woe to
those who attempt invading them, or prying too
cautiously about!</p>

<p>Not choosing to be devoured, we left many a mount
of fragments unnoticed, and made the best of our
way to a little green, free from weeds or adders,
bounded on one side by a miserable shed, decorated
with the name of the Podesta’s residence, and on the
other by a circular church. Some remains of tolerable
antique sculpture are enchased in the walls; and the
dome, supported by pillars of a smooth Grecian
marble, though uncouth and ill-proportioned, impresses
a sort of veneration, and transports the fancy
to the twilight glimmering period when it was raised.</p>

<p>Having surveyed what little was visible, and given
as much career to our imaginations as the scene
inspired, we walked over a soil composed of crumbling
bricks and cement to the cathedral; whose arches,
turned on the ancient Roman principle, convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
us that it dates as high as the sixth or seventh
century.</p>

<p>Nothing can well be more fantastic than the ornaments
of this structure, formed from the ruins of the
Pagan temples of Altina, and incrusted with a gilt
mosaic, like that which covers our Edward the Confessor’s
tomb. The pavement, composed of various
precious marbles, is richer and more beautiful than
one could have expected, in a place where every other
object savours of the grossest barbarism. At the
farther end, beyond the altar, appears a semicircular
niche, with seats like the gradines of a diminutive
amphitheatre; above rise the quaint forms of the
apostles, in red, blue, green, and black mosaic, and
in the midst of the goodly group a sort of marble
chair, cool and penitential enough, where <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lorenzo
Giustiniani sat to hold a provincial council, the Lord
knows how long ago! The fount for holy water stands
by the principal entrance, fronting this curious recess,
and seems to have belonged to some place of Gentile
worship. The figures of horned imps cling round its
sides, more devilish, more Egyptian, than any I ever
beheld. The dragons on old china are not more
whimsical: I longed to have it filled with bats’ blood,
and to have sent it by way of present to the Sabbath;
I can assure you it would have done honour to their
witcheries. The sculpture is not the most delicate,
but I cannot say a great deal about it, as but little
light reaches the spot where it is fixed. Indeed, the
whole church is far from luminous, its windows being
narrow and near the roof, with shutters composed of
blocks of marble, which nothing but the last whirlwind,
one would think, could move from their hinges.</p>

<p>By the time we had examined every nook and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
corner of this singular edifice, and caught, perhaps,
some small portion of sanctity by sitting in San
Lorenzo’s chair, dinner was prepared in a neighbouring
convent, and the nuns, allured by the sound of
our flutes and oboes, peeped out of their cells and
showed themselves by dozens at the grate. Some few
agreeable faces and interesting eyes enlivened the dark
sisterhood; all seemed to catch a gleam of pleasure
from the music; two or three of them, probably the
last immured, let fall a tear, and suffered the recollection
of the world and its profane joys to interrupt for
a moment their sacred tranquillity.</p>

<p>We stayed till the sun was low, and the breezes
blew cold from the ocean, on purpose that they might
listen as long as possible to a harmony which seemed
to issue, as the old abbess expressed herself, from the
gates of paradise ajar. A thousand benedictions
consecrated our departure; twilight came on just as
we entered the bark and rowed out upon the waves,
agitated by a fresh gale, but fearing nothing under
the protection of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Margherita, whose good wishes
our music had secured.</p>

THE BALCONY ON THE GRAND CANAL<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> history of Venice reads like a romance; the place
seems a fantastic vision at the best, from which the
world must at last awake some morning, and find that
after all it has only been dreaming, and that there
never was any such city.... The Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Mark, standing so solidly, with a thousand years
under the feet of its innumerable pillars, is not in the
least grey with time—no greyer than a Greek lyric.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry small">
    <div class="verse indent0a">‘All has suffered a sea-change</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into something rich and strange,’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">in this fantastic city. The prose of earth has risen
poetry from its baptism in the sea....</p>

<p>The cunning city beguiles you street by street, and
step by step, into some old court, where a flight of
marble stairs leads high up to the pillared gallery of
an empty palace, with a climbing vine green and
purple on its old decay, and one or two gaunt trees
stretching their heads to look into the lofty windows,—blind
long ago to their leafy tenderness,—while at
their feet is some sumptuously carven well, with the
beauty of the sculptor’s soul wrought for ever into
the stone. Or Venice lures you in a gondola, into one
of her remote canals, where you glide through an
avenue as secret and as still as if sea-deep under our
work-day world; where the grim heads carven over
the water-gates of the palaces stare at you in
austere surprise; where the innumerable balconies
are full of the absences of gay cavaliers and gentle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
dames, gossiping and making love to one another,
from their airy perches. Or if the city’s mood is one
of bolder charm, she fascinates you in the very places
where you think her power is the weakest, and as if
impatient of your forgetfulness, dares a wilder beauty,
and enthrals with a yet more unearthly and incredible
enchantment.... But whatever surprise of
memorable or beautiful Venice may prepare for your
forgetfulness, be sure it will be complete and resistless.
Nay, what potenter magic needs my Venice to
revivify her past whenever she will, than the serpent
cunning of her Grand Canal?... For myself, I
must count as half lost the year spent in Venice before
I took a house upon the Grand Canal. There alone
can existence have the perfect local flavour. But by
what witchery touched, one’s being suffers the
common sea-change, till life at last seems to ebb and
flow with the tide in that wonder-avenue of palaces,
it would be idle to attempt to tell. I can only take
you to our dear little balcony at Casa Falier, and
comment not very coherently on the scene upon the
water under us....</p>

<p>October is the month of the sunsets, and are best
seen from the Public Gardens, whence one looks westward,
and beholds them glorious behind the domes
and towers of San Giorgio Maggiore and the church of
the Redentore. Sometimes, when the sky is clear,
your sunset on the lagoon is a fine thing; for then
the sun goes down into the water with a broad trail
of bloody red behind him, as if, wounded far out at
sea, he had dragged himself landward across the
crimsoning expanses, and fallen and died as he
reached the land. But we (upon whom the idleness
of Venice grows daily, and from whom the Gardens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
therefore, grow further and further) are commonly
content to take our bit of sunset as we get it from
our balcony, through the avenue opened by the narrow
canal opposite. We like the earlier afternoon to have
been a little rainy, when we have our sunset splendid
as the fury of a passionate beauty—all tears and fire.
There is a pretty but impertinent little palace on the
corner which is formed by this canal as it enters the
Canalazzo, and from the palace, high over the smaller
channel, hangs an airy balcony. When the sunset
sky, under and over the balcony, is of that pathetic
and angry red which I have tried to figure, we think
ourselves rich in the neighbourhood of that part of
the ‘Palace of Art,’ whereon</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry small">
    <div class="verse indent0a">‘The light aerial gallery, golden railed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Burnt like a fringe of fire.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And so, after all, we do not think we have lost any
greater thing in not seeing the sunset from the
Gardens, where half a dozen artists are always painting
it, or from the quay of the Zattere, where it is
splendid over and under the island church of San
Giorgio in Alga....</p>

<p>About nightfall came the market boats on their
way to the Rialto market, bringing heaped fruits and
vegetables from the mainland; and far into the night
the soft dip of the oar, and the gurgling progress of
the boats was company and gentlest lullaby. By
which time, if we looked out again, we found the moon
risen, and the ghost of dead Venice shadowily happy
in haunting the lonesome palaces, and the sea, which
had so loved Venice, kissing and caressing the tide-worn
marble steps where her feet seemed to rest.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> started together, Lord Byron and myself, in my
little Milanese vehicle, for Fusina,—his portly gondolier,
Tito, in a rich livery and most redundant
mustachios.... As we proceeded across the
lagoon in his gondola, the sun was just setting, and
it was an evening such as Romance would have
chosen for a first sight of Venice, rising with her
‘tiara of bright towers’ above the wave; while to
complete, as might be imagined, the solemn interest
of the scene, I beheld it in company with him who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>

might, under other circumstances, have inspired within
me, the mood of the mind in which I now viewed it was
altogether the very reverse of what might have been
expected. The exuberant gaiety of my companion, and
the recollections—anything but romantic—into which
our conversation wandered, put at once completely
to flight all poetic and historical associations; and
our course was, I am almost ashamed to say, one of
uninterrupted merriment and laughter, till we found
ourselves at the steps of my friend’s palazzo on the
Grand Canal.</p>

<a id="p_226"></a>A VENETIAN MARKET<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> gondola was waiting as usual at the corner; it
took them but a very little way, and landed them on
the quay near the Rialto.... All the pictures out
of all the churches were buying and selling in this
busy market; Virgins went by, carrying their Infants;
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter is bargaining his silver fish; Judas is making
a low bow to a fat old monk, who holds up his brown
skirts and steps with bare legs into a mysterious
black gondola that has been waiting by the bridge,
and that silently glides away.... A girl came
quietly through the crowd, carrying her head nobly
above the rest, and looking straight before her with
a sweet and generous face. ‘What a beautiful
creature! Brava, brava!’ shrieked Lady W. The
girl hung her sweet head and blushed. Titian’s
mother, out of the ‘Presentation,’ who was sitting
by with her basket of eggs, smiled and patted the
young Madonna on her shoulder. ‘They are only
saying good things; they mean no harm,’ said the
old woman.... Then a cripple went along on his
crutches; then came a woman carrying a beautiful
little boy, with a sort of turban round her head....
One corner of the market was given up to great
hobgoblin pumpkins; tomatoes were heaped in the
stalls; oranges and limes were not yet over; but
perhaps the fish-stalls are the prettiest of all. Silver
fish tied up in stars with olive-green leaves, golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
fish, as in miracles, with noble people serving. There
are the jewellers’ shops too, but their wares do not

<a id="p_228"></a>THE GRAND CANAL<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was not five o’clock before I was aroused by a loud
din of voices and splashing of water under my balcony.
Looking out, I beheld the Grand Canal so entirely
covered with fruits and vegetables, on rafts and in
barges, that I could scarcely distinguish a wave.
Loads of grapes, peaches, and melons arrived, and
disappeared in an instant, for every vessel was in
motion; and the crowds of purchasers, hurrying from
boat to boat, formed one of the liveliest pictures
imaginable. Amongst the multitudes I remarked a
good many whose dress and carriage announced something
above the common rank; and upon inquiry I
found they were noble Venetians, just come from their
casinos, and met to refresh themselves with fruit,
before they retired to sleep for the day.</p>

<p>Whilst I was observing them, the sun began to
colour the balustrades of the palaces, and the pure
exhilarating air of the morning drawing me abroad,
I procured a gondola, laid in my provision of bread
and grapes, and was rowed under the Rialto, down
the Grand Canal, to the marble steps of S. Maria della
Salute, erected by the Senate in performance of a vow
to the Holy Virgin, who begged off a terrible pestilence
in 1630. I gazed, delighted with its superb frontispiece
and dome, relieved by a clear blue sky. To criticize
columns or pediments of the different façades would
be time lost; since one glance upon the worst view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
that has been taken of them conveys a far better idea
than the most elaborate description. The great bronze
portal opened whilst I was standing on the steps which
lead to it, and discovered the interior of the dome,
where I expatiated in solitude; no mortal appearing
except an old priest who trimmed the lamps, and
muttered a prayer before the high altar, still wrapped
in shadows. The sunbeams began to strike against
the windows of the cupola just as I left the church,
and was wafted across the waves to the spacious
platform in front of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giorgio Maggiore, by far
the most perfect and beautiful edifice my eyes ever
beheld.</p>

<p>When my first transport was a little subsided, and
I had examined the graceful design of each particular
ornament, and united the just proportion and grand
effect of the whole in my mind, I planted my umbrella
on the margin of the sea, and reclining under its shade,
my feet dangling over the waters, viewed the vast
range of palaces, of porticos, of towers, opening on
every side and extending out of sight. The Doge’s
residence and the tall columns at the entrance of the
place of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, form, together with the arcades of
the public library, the lofty Campanile and the
cupolas of the ducal church, one of the most striking
groups of buildings that art can boast of. To behold
at one glance these stately fabrics, so illustrious in
the records of former ages, before which, in the flourishing
times of the republic, so many valiant chiefs and
princes have landed, loaded with the spoils of different
nations, was a spectacle I had long and ardently
desired. I thought of the days of Frederic Barbarossa,
when looking up the piazza of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, along which
he marched in solemn procession, to cast himself at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
feet of Alexander the Third, and pay a tardy homage
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s successor. Here were no longer those
splendid fleets that attended his progress; one solitary
galeass was all I beheld, anchored opposite the palace
of the Doge, and surrounded by crowds of gondolas,
whose sable hues contrasted strongly with its vermilion
oars and shining ornaments. A party-coloured multitude
was continually shifting from one side of the
piazza to the other; whilst senators and magistrates
in long black robes were already arriving to fill their
respective charges.</p>

<p>I contemplated the busy scene from my peaceful
platform, where nothing stirred but aged devotees
creeping to their devotions; and, whilst I remained
thus calm and tranquil, heard the distant buzz and
rumour of the town. Fortunately a length of waves
rolled between me and its tumults; so that I ate my
grapes, and read Metastasio, undisturbed by officiousness
or curiosity.</p>

THE COLOUR OF VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Venice</span> is a delightful place for a man sick or well....
No noise, no flies, no dust. An air so gentle that it
could scarce be called a breeze. A sun that warms
and rarely burns: a light, veiled white and soft, and
lets one read without glare-made fatigue; a climate
which asks no man to do anything, and is answered
affirmatively by all. So we, too, should have been
content not to do.</p>

<p>The more so that in Venice there is no monotony.
Of all places on earth it is the most variable in its
moods. The changes in its colour are as great from
day to day, and sometimes from hour to hour, as in
more northern climes from month to month, or even
from season to season. This variableness, the despair
of her studious student, is the joy of her loitering
lover. The painter finds a lovely subject, indeed they
are all around him, and goes from his first day’s work,
and perhaps his second, content that he has caught
the tone that charmed him. Even as he says so a
change comes on that makes him doubtful of that
work. The golden light has become silver, the cool
blue shadows are swimming in a <i lang="it">cinque cento</i> richness.
He must alter his whole scheme of colour or go home.
The next day it may be worse, and he may wait for
weeks for the effect that he had not quite time to
render. Thus it is that finished studio-painted pictures
of Venice so rarely tell of Venice to the man who knows
it, whilst the quick sketches made by the artist who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
can see, and is possessed of the hand that can render,
faithful to his eye and taste, are so very lovely.</p>

<p>To the idle man this change of mood and colour is,
or should be, perfection. He should never tire, and
rarely does so, of his fickle mistress. He is floating
to-day where he floated yesterday. The lagoon, the
island, the buildings are all the same, but how different.
The Euganean Hills, or perhaps the Alps, that spoke
to him of Shelley, or of snow, the distant line of
terra-firma that held, as in a fine cut frame, the
steely lagoon waters, are now hidden in a mist of
light. The Ducal Palace, the Salute’s dome, that
yesterday appeared clear and earthly, the grand
campanile of San Marco—alas! that it has fallen a
victim to its own weight and Time’s corrosion—the
scarcely less beautiful campanile of San Giorgio, whose
clean outlines stood out so sharply in the atmosphere
of vivid blue, to-day all swim ethereal in a golden haze.
’Tis all there, but a dream rather than a reality, a
spirit picture more than a motive for a sketch.</p>

<a id="p_234"></a>THE GLORY OF COLOUR IN ITALY<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> learn for the first time in this Italian climate
what colours really are. No wonder it produces
painters. An English artist of any enthusiasm might
shed tears of vexation to think of the dull medium
through which blue and red come to him in his own
atmosphere, compared with this. One day we saw a
boat pass us, which instantly reminded us of Titian, and
accounted for him: and yet it contained nothing but
an old boatman in a red cap, and some women with
him in other colours, one of them in a bright yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
petticoat. But a red cap in Italy goes by you, not
like a mere cap, much less anything vulgar or butcher-like,
but like what it is, an intense specimen of the
colour of red. It is like a scarlet bud in the blue atmosphere.
The old boatman, with his brown hue, his
white shirt, and his red cap, made a complete picture;
and so did the woman and the yellow petticoat. I
have seen pieces of orange-coloured silk hanging out
against a wall at a dyer’s, which gave the eye a pleasure
truly sensual. Some of these boatmen are very fine
men. I was rowed to shore one day by a man the very
image of Kemble. It was really grand to see the mixed
power and peacefulness with which all his limbs came
into play as he pulled the oars, occasionally turning
his heroic profile to give a glance behind him at other
boats.</p>

her familiar, gradually rose up before her; the
mosque-like Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marc, the tall Campanile
red in the sun, the Moresco Palace of the Doges, the
deadly Bridge of Sighs, and the dark structure to
which it leads.</p>

<p>Venice had not then fallen. The gorgeous standards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
of the sovereign republic, and its tributary kingdoms,
still waved in the Place of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marc; the Bucentaur
was not rotting in the Arsenal, and the warlike galleys
of the State cruised about the lagoon; a busy and
picturesque population swarmed in all directions;
and the Venetian noble, the haughtiest of men, might
still be seen proudly moving from the council of state,
or stepping into a gondola amid a bowing crowd. All
was stirring life, yet all was silent; the fantastic
architecture, the glowing sky, the flitting gondolas,
and the brilliant crowd gliding about with noiseless
step, this city without sound, it seemed a dream!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The ambassador had engaged for Lady Annabel a
palace on the Grand Canal, belonging to Count
Manfrini. It was a structure of great size and magnificence,
and rose out of the water with a flight of
marble steps. Within was a vast gallery, lined with
statues and busts on tall pedestals; suites of spacious
apartments, with marble floors and hung with satin;
ceilings painted by Tintoretto and full of Turkish
trophies; furniture alike sumptuous and massy; the
gilding, although of two hundred years’ duration, as
bright and burnished as if it had but yesterday been
touched with the brush; sequin gold, as the Venetians
tell you to this day with pride. But even their old furniture
will soon not be left to them, as palaces are now
daily broken up like old ships, and their colossal spoils
consigned to Hanway Yard and Bond Street, whence,
re-burnished and vamped up, their Titanic proportions
in time appropriately figure in the boudoirs of
Mayfair and the miniature saloons of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s.
Many a fine lady now sits in a Doge’s chair, and many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>

<a id="p_237b"></a>A FIRST IMPRESSION IN VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent">‘<span class="smcap">Is</span> this Venice?—the rich bride of the sea?—the
mistress of the world?’</p>

<p>I saw the magnificent square of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark. ‘Here
is life!’ people said.... The square of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s is
the heart of Venice, where life does exist. Shops of
books, pearls, and pictures, adorn the long colonnades,
where, however, it was not yet animated enough.
A crowd of Greeks and Turks, in bright dresses, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
with long pipes in their mouths, sat quietly outside
the cafés. The sun shone upon the golden cupola of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s Church, and upon the glorious bronze
horses over the portal. From the red masts of the
ships from Cyprus, Candia, and Morea, depended
the motionless flags. A flock of pigeons filled the
square by thousands, and went daintily upon the
broad pavement.</p>

<p>I visited the Ponte Rialto, the pulse-vein which
spoke of life; and I soon comprehended the great
picture of Venice—the picture of mourning—the
impression of my own soul. I seemed yet to be at sea,
only removed from a smaller to a greater ship, a
floating ark.</p>

<p>The evening came; and when the moonbeams cast
their uncertain light and diffused broader shadows, I
felt myself more at home; in the hour of the spirit-world.
I could first become familiar with the dead
bride. I stood at the open window: the black gondola
glided quickly over the dark, moonlit waters. I
thought upon the seaman’s song of kissing and of love;
felt a bitterness towards Annunciata.... I entered
a gondola, and allowed myself to be taken through
the streets in the silent evening. The rowers sung their
alternating song, but it was not from the <i lang="it">Gerusalemme
Liberata</i>; the Venetians had forgotten even
the old melodies of the heart, for their Doges were
dead, and foreign hands had bound the wings of the
lion, which was harnessed to their triumphal car.</p>

<p>‘I will seize upon life—will enjoy it to the last
drop!’ said I, as the gondola lay still. I went to my
own room, and lay down to sleep. Such was my first
day in Venice.</p>

A VENETIAN DREAM<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was now quite night, and we were at the water-side.
There lay here, a black boat, with a little house or
cabin in it of the same mournful colour. When I had
taken my seat in this, the boat was paddled, by two
men, towards a great light, lying in the distance on
the sea.</p>

<p>Ever and again, there was a dismal sigh of wind.
It ruffled the water, and rocked the boat, and sent
the dark clouds flying before the stars. I could not
but think how strange it was, to be floating away at
that hour: leaving the land behind, and going on,
towards this light upon the sea. It soon began to
burn brighter; and from being one light became a cluster
of tapers, twinkling and shining out of the water, as
the boat approached towards them by a dreamy kind
of track, marked out upon the sea by posts and piles.</p>

<p>We had floated on, five miles or so, over the dark
water, when I heard it rippling in my dream, against
some obstruction near at hand. Looking out attentively,
I saw, through the gloom, a something black
and massive—like a shore, but lying close and flat
upon the water, like a raft—which we were gliding past.
The chief of the two rowers said it was a burial-place.</p>

<p>Full of the interest and wonder which a cemetery
lying out there, in the lonely sea, inspired, I turned to
gaze upon it as it should recede in our path, when it
was quickly shut out from my view. Before I knew
by what, or how, I found that we were gliding up a
street—a phantom street; the houses rising on both
sides, from the water, and the black boat gliding on
beneath their windows. Lights were shining from
some of these casements, plumbing the depth of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
black stream with their reflected rays, but all was
profoundly silent.</p>

<p>So we advanced into this ghostly city, continuing
to hold our course through narrow streets and lanes,
all filled and flowing with water. Some of the corners,
where our way branched off, were so acute and narrow,
that it seemed impossible for the long slender boat
to turn them; but the rowers, with a low melodious
cry of warning, sent it skimming on without a pause.
Sometimes, the rowers of another black boat like our
own, echoed the cry, and slackening their speed (as I
thought we did ours) would come flitting past us like
a dark shadow. Other boats, of the same sombre hue,
were lying moored, I thought, to painted pillars, near
to dark mysterious doors, that opened straight upon
the water. Some of these were empty; in some, the
rowers lay asleep; towards one, I saw some figures
coming down a gloomy archway from the interior of
a palace: gaily dressed, and attended by torchbearers.
It was but a glimpse I had of them, for a bridge,
so low and close upon the boat seemed ready to
fall down and crush us; one of the many bridges
that perplexed the dream: blotted them out, instantly.
On we went, floating towards the heart of
this strange place—with water all about us where
never water was elsewhere—clusters of houses,
churches, heaps of stately buildings growing out of
it—and, everywhere, the same extraordinary silence.
Presently, we shot across a broad and open stream;
and passing, as I thought, before a spacious paved
quay, where the bright lamps with which it was
illuminated showed long rows of arches and pillars,
of ponderous construction and great strength, but
as light to the eye as garlands of hoar-frost or gossamer—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
where, for the first time, I saw people walking—arrived
at a flight of steps leading from the water
to a large mansion, where, having passed through
corridors and galleries innumerable, I lay down to
rest; listening to the black boats stealing up and
down below the window on the rippling water, till
I fell asleep.</p>

<p>The glory of the day that broke upon me in this
dream; its freshness, motion, buoyancy; its sparkles of
the sun in water; its clear blue sky and rustling air; no
waking words can tell. But, from my window, I looked
down on boats and barks; on masts, sails, cordage,
flags; on groups of busy sailors, working at the cargoes
of these vessels; on wide quays, strewn with bales,
casks, merchandise of many kinds; on great ships,
lying near at hand in stately indolence; on islands,
crowned with gorgeous domes and turrets: and where
golden crosses glittered in the light, atop of wondrous
churches, springing from the sea! Going down upon
the margin of the green sea, rolling on before the door,
and filling all the streets, I came upon a place of such
surpassing beauty, and such grandeur, that all the
rest was poor and faded, in comparison with its
absorbing loveliness.</p>

<p>It was a great piazza, as I thought; anchored, like all
the rest, in the deep ocean. On its broad bosom, was a
palace, more majestic and magnificent in its old age,
than all the buildings of the earth, in the high prime
and fulness of their youth. Cloisters and galleries:
so light, they might have been the work of fairy hands:
so strong that centuries had battered them in vain:
wound round and round this palace, and enfolded it
with a cathedral, gorgeous in the wild luxuriant
fancies, of the East. At no great distance from its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
porch, a lofty tower, standing by itself and
rearing its proud head, alone, into the sky, looked
out upon the Adriatic Sea. Near to the margin
of the stream were two ill-omened pillars of
red granite; one having on its top a figure with a
sword and shield; the other, a winged lion. Not far
from these again, a second tower: richest of the rich
in all its decorations: even here, where all was rich:
sustained aloft, a great orb, gleaming with gold and
deepest blue: the Twelve Signs painted on it, and a
mimic sun revolving in its course around them: while
above, two bronze giants hammered out the hours
upon a sounding bell. An oblong square of lofty houses
of the whitest stone, surrounded by a light and beautiful
arcade, formed part of this enchanted scene; and,
here and there, gay masts for flags rose, tapering,
from the pavement of the unsubstantial ground.</p>

<p>I thought I entered the cathedral, and went in and
out among its many arches: traversing its whole
extent. A grand and dreamy structure, of immense
proportions; golden with old mosaics; redolent of
perfumes; dim with the smoke of incense; costly in
treasure of precious stones and metals, glittering
through iron bars; holy with the bodies of deceased
saints; rainbow-hued with windows of stained glass;
dark with carved woods and coloured marbles;
obscure in its vast heights, and lengthened distances;
shining with silver lamps and winking lights; unreal,
fantastic, solemn, inconceivable throughout. I
thought I entered the old palace; pacing silent galleries
and council-chambers, where the old rulers of this
mistress of the waters looked sternly out, in pictures,
from the walls, and where her high-prowed galleys,
still victorious on canvas, fought and conquered as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
of old. I thought I wandered through its halls of
state and triumph—bare and empty now!—and
musing on its pride and might, extinct: for that was
past; all past: heard a voice say, ‘Some tokens of
its ancient rule, and some consoling reasons for its
downfall, may be traced here, yet!’</p>

<p>I dreamed that I was led on, then, into some jealous
rooms, communicating with a prison near the palace;
separated from it by a lofty bridge crossing a narrow
street; and called, I dreamed, the Bridge of Sighs.</p>

<p>But first I passed two jagged slits in a stone wall;
the lions’ mouths—now toothless—where, in the
distempered horror of my sleep, I thought denunciations
of innocent men to the old wicked Council, had
been dropped through, many a time, when the night
was dark. So, when I saw the council-room to which
such prisoners were taken for examination, and the
door by which they passed out, when they were condemned—a
door that never closed upon a man with
life and hope before him—my heart appeared to die
within me.</p>

<p>It was smitten harder though, when, torch in hand,
I descended from the cheerful day into two ranges,
one below another, of dismal, awful, horrible stone
cells. They were quite dark. Each had a loophole
in its massive wall, where, in the old time, every day,
a torch was placed—I dreamed—to light the prisoner
within, for half an hour. The captives, by the glimmering
of these brief rays, had scratched and cut inscriptions
in the blackened vaults. I saw them. For their
labour with a rusty nail’s point, had outlived their
agony and them, through many generations.</p>

<p>One cell, I saw, in which no man remained for more
than four-and-twenty hours; being marked for dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
before he entered it. Hard by, another, and a dismal
one, whereto, at midnight, the confessor came—a
monk brown-robed, and hooded—ghastly in the day,
and free bright air, but in the midnight of that murky
prison, Hope’s extinguisher, and Murder’s herald. I
had my foot upon the spot, where, at the same dread
hour, the shriven prisoner was strangled; and struck
my hand upon the guilty door—low browed and
stealthy—through which the lumpish sack was carried
out into a boat, and rowed away, and drowned where
it was death to cast a net.</p>

<p>Around this dungeon stronghold, and above some
part of it: licking the rough walls without, and smearing
them with damp and slime within: stuffing dank
weeds and refuse into chinks and crevices, as if the
very stones and bars had mouths to stop: furnishing
a smooth road for the removal of the bodies of the
secret victims of the State—a road so ready that it
went along with them, and ran before them, like a
cruel officer—flowed the same water that filled this
dream of mine, and made it seem one, even at the time.</p>

<p>Descending from the palace by a staircase, called,
I thought, the Giant’s—I had some imaginary recollection
of an old man abdicating, coming, more slowly
and more feebly, down it, when he heard the bell,
proclaiming his successor—I glided off, in one of the
dark boats, until we came to an old arsenal guarded
by four marble lions. To make my dream more
monstrous and unlikely, one of these had words and
sentences upon its body, inscribed there, at an unknown
time, and in an unknown language; so that their
purport was a mystery to all men....</p>

<p>In the luxurious wonder of so rare a dream, I took
but little heed of time, and had but little understanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
of its flight. But there were days and nights in it;
and when the sun was high, and when the rays of
lamps were crooked in the running water, I was still
afloat, I thought: plashing the slippery walls and
houses with the cleavings of the tide, as my black
boat, borne upon it, skimmed along the streets.</p>

<p>Sometimes, alighting at the doors of churches and
vast palaces, I wandered on, from room to room,
from aisle to aisle, through labyrinths of rich altars,
ancient monuments; decayed apartments where the
furniture, half awful, half grotesque, was mouldering
away. Pictures were there, replete with such enduring
beauty and expression; with such passion, truth and
power: that they seemed so many young and fresh
realities among a host of spectres. I thought these,
often intermingled with the old days of the city: with
its beauties, tyrants, captains, patriots, merchants,
courtiers, priests: nay, with its very stones, and bricks,
and public places; all of which lived again, about me,
on the walls. Then, coming down some marble staircase
where the water lapped and oozed against the
lower steps, I passed into my boat again, and went on
in my dream.</p>

<p>Floating down narrow lanes, where carpenters, at
work with plane and chisel in their shops, tossed the
light shaving straight upon the water, where it lay
like weed, or ebbed away before me in a tangled heap.
Past open doors, decayed and rotten from long steeping
in the wet, through which some scanty patch of vine
shone green and bright, making unusual shadows on
the pavement with its trembling leaves. Past quays
and terraces, where women, gracefully veiled, were
passing and repassing, and where idlers were reclining
in the sunshine, on flagstones and on flights of steps.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
Past bridges, where there were idlers too; loitering
and looking over. Below stone balconies, erected at
a giddy height, before the loftiest windows of the
loftiest houses. Past plots of garden, theatre, shrines,
prodigious piles of architecture—Gothic—Saracenic—fanciful
with all the fancies of all times and countries.
Past buildings that were high, and low, and black,
and white, and straight, and crooked; mean and
grand, crazy and strong. Twining among a tangled
lot of boats and barges, and shooting out at last into
a Grand Canal! There, in the errant fancy of my
dream, I saw old Shylock passing to and fro upon a
bridge, all built upon with shops and humming with
the tongues of men; a form I seemed to know for
Desdemona’s leaned down through a latticed blind
to pluck a flower. And, in the dream, I thought that
Shakespeare’s spirit was abroad upon the water somewhere:
stealing through the city.</p>

<p>At night, when two votive lamps burnt before an
image of the Virgin, in a gallery outside the great
cathedral, near the roof, I fancied that the great
piazza of the Winged Lion was a blaze of cheerful
light, and that its whole arcade was thronged with
people; while crowds were diverting themselves in
splendid coffee-houses opening from it—which were
never shut, I thought, but open all night long. When
the bronze giants struck the hour of midnight on the
bell, I thought the life and animation of the city were
all centred here; and as I rowed away, abreast the
silent quays, I only saw them dotted, here and there,
with sleeping boatmen wrapped up in their cloaks, and
lying at full length upon the stones.</p>

<p>But close about the quays and churches, palaces
and prisons: sucking at their walls, and welling up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
into the secret places of the town: crept the water
always. Noiseless and watchful: coiled round and
round it, in its many folds, like an old serpent:
waiting for the time, I thought, when people should
look down into its depths for any stone of the old city
that had claimed to be its mistress.</p>

<p>Thus it floated me away, until I awoke in the old
market-place at Verona. I have, many and many a
time, thought since, of this strange dream upon the
water: half-wondering if it lie there yet, and if its
name be <span class="smcap">Venice</span>.</p>

<p>Far other be the doom of my own friends—of pious

lovely things! Nor for these do I desire a seat at
Florian’s marble tables, or a perch in Quadri’s
window, though the former supply dainty food, and
the latter command a bird’s-eye view of the Piazza.
Rather would I lead them to a certain humble tavern
on the Zattere. It is a quaint, low-built, unpretending
little place, near a bridge, with a garden hard by
which sends a cataract of honeysuckles sunward over
a too-jealous wall. In front lies a Mediterranean
steamer, which all day long has been discharging
cargo. Gazing westward up Giudecca, masts and
funnels bar the sunset and the Paduan hills; and from
a little front room of the <i lang="it">trattoria</i> the view is so marine
that one keeps fancying oneself in some ship’s cabin.
Sea-captains sit and smoke beside their glass of grog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
in the pavilion and the <i lang="it">caffè</i>. But we do not seek their
company at dinner-time. Our way lies under yonder
arch, and up the narrow alley into a paved court.
Here are oleanders in pots, and plants of Japanese
spindle-wood in tubs; and from the walls beneath
the window hang cages of all sorts of birds—a talking
parrot, a whistling blackbird, goldfinches, canaries,
linnets. Athos, the fat dog, who goes to market
daily in a <i lang="it">barchetta</i> with his master, snuffs around.
‘Where are Porthos and Aramis, my friend?’ Athos
does not take the joke; he only wags his stump of
tail and pokes his nose into my hand. What a Tartufe’s
nose it is! Its bridge displays the full parade
of leather-bound brass-nailed muzzle. But beneath
this muzzle is a patent sham. The frame does not
even pretend to close on Athos’ jaw, and the wise
dog wears it like a decoration. A little further we meet
that ancient grey cat, who has no discoverable name,
but is famous for the sprightliness and grace with
which she bears her eighteen years. Not far from the
cat one is sure to find Carlo—the bird-like, bright-faced,
close-cropped Venetian urchin, whose duty it
is to trot backwards and forwards between the cellar
and the dining-tables. At the end of the court we
walk into the kitchen, where the black-capped little
<i lang="it">padrone</i> and the gigantic white-capped <i lang="fr">chef</i> are in
close consultation. Here we have the privilege of
inspecting the larder—fish of various sorts, meat,
vegetables, several kinds of birds, pigeons, tordi,
beccafichi, geese, wild ducks, chickens, woodcock, etc.,
according to the season. We select our dinner, and
retire to eat it either in the court among the birds
beneath the vines, or in the low dark room which
occupies one side of it. Artists of many nationalities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
and divers ages frequent this house; and the talk
arising from the several little tables turns upon points
of interest and beauty in the life and landscape of
Venice. There can be no difference of opinion about
the excellence of the <i lang="fr">cuisine</i>, or about the reasonable
charges of this <i lang="it">trattoria</i>.... There is no noise, no
bustle, no brutality of waiters, no <i lang="fr">ahurissement</i> of
tourists. And when dinner is done, we can sit a while
over our cigarette and coffee until the night invites
us to a stroll along the Zattere or a <i lang="it">giro</i> in the gondola.</p>

<a id="p_249"></a>VENETIAN CAFFÈS<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">What</span> is Florian’s? It is the principal, largest, and
most fashionable caffè on the Piazza di San Marco.
The caffè in itself is in many respects a speciality of
Venetian life, and has been so since the days of
Goldoni. The readers of his comedies, so abundantly
rich in local colouring, will not have failed to observe
that the caffè plays a larger part in the life of Venice
than is the case in any other city. Probably no
Venetian passes a single day without visiting once
at least, if not oftener, his accustomed caffè. Men of
business write their letters and arrange their meetings
there. Men of pleasure know that they shall find their
peers there. Mere loafers take their seats there, and
gaze at the stream of life, as it flows past them, for
hours together. And, most marked speciality of all,
Venice is the only city in Italy where the native
female aristocracy frequents the caffè. Indeed, I
know no place in all the Peninsula where so large an
amount of Italian beauty may be seen as among the
fashionable crowd at Florian’s on a brilliant midsummer
moonlight night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>Venice is of all the cities in the world the one
which those who have never seen it know best. The
peculiarities of it are so marked and so unlike anything
else in the world, and the graphic representations
of every part of the city are so numerous and so
admirably accurate, that every traveller finds it to
be exactly what he was prepared to see, and can
hardly fancy that he sees the Queen of the Adriatic
for the first time. I may therefore assume, perhaps,
that my readers are acquainted with the appearance
of that most matchless of city spaces, the Piazza di
San Marco. They will readily call to mind the long
series of arcades that form the two long sides of the
parallelogram which has the gorgeous front of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Mark’s Church occupying the entirety of one of the
shorter sides. Well, about half-way up the length
of the piazza six of the arches on the right hand of
one facing <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s Church are occupied by the
celebrated caffè. The six never-closed rooms, corresponding
each with one of the arches of the arcade,
are very small, and would not suffice to accommodate
a twentieth part of the throng which finds itself at
Florian’s, quite as a matter of course, every fine
summer’s night. But nobody thinks of entering
these smartly-furnished little cabinets save for
breakfast or during the hours of the day.</p>

<p>Some take their evening ice or coffee on the seats
under the arcade, either immediately in front of the
cabinets or around the pillars which support the
arches, and thus have an opportunity of observing
the never-ceasing and ever-varying stream of life that
flows by them under the arcade. But the vast
majority of the crowd place themselves on chairs
arranged around little tables set out on the flags of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
the piazza. A hundred or so of these little tables
are placed in long rows extending far out into the
piazza, and far on either side beyond the extent of
the six arches which are occupied by the caffè itself.
A London or New York policeman would have his
very soul revolted, and conclude that there must be
something very rotten indeed in the state of a city
in which the public way could be thus encumbered
and no cry of ‘move on’ ever heard. Assuredly, it
is public ground which Florian, in the person of his
nineteenth-century representative, thus occupies with
his tables and chairs. Probably, if a Venetian were
asked by what right he does so, the question would
seem to him much as if one asked by what right the
tide covers the shallows of the lagoon. It always has
been so. It is in the natural order of things. And
how could Venice live without Florian’s?...</p>

<p>I am tempted to endeavour to give the reader some
picture of the scene on the piazza on a night when
(as is the case almost every other evening) a military
band is playing in the middle of the open space, and
the cosmopolitan crowd is assembled in force—to
describe the wonderful surroundings of the scene,
the charm of the quietude broken by no sound of
hoof or of wheel, the soft and tempered light, the
gay clatter, athwart which comes every fifteen
minutes the solemn mellow tone of the great clock
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, with importunate warning that another
pleasant quarter of an hour has drifted away down
the stream of time. It is a scene that tempts the
pen. But the well-dressed portion of mankind is
very similar in all countries and under all circumstances,
and perhaps my readers may be more
interested in a few traits of the popular life of Venice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
which the magnificent Piazza of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark is not the
best place for studying, for some of the most characteristic
phases of it are absolutely banished thence.
The strolling musician or singer, who may be heard
every night in other parts of the city, never plies his
trade on the piazza. Mendicancy, which is more rife
at Venice, I am sorry to say, than in any other Italian
city, except perhaps Naples, is not tolerated on the
piazza.</p>

<p>But if we wish for a good specimen of the truly
popular life of Venice, it will not be necessary to
wander far from the great centre of the piazza.
Coming down the Piazzetta, or Little Piazza, which
opens out of the great square at one end, and abuts
on the open lagoon opposite the island of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George
at the other, and turning round the corner of the
Ducal Palace, we cross the bridge over the canal,
which above our head is spanned by the ‘Bridge of
Sighs,’ with its ‘palace and a prison on each hand,’
as Byron sings, and find ourselves on the ‘Riva degli
Schiavoni’—the quay at which the Slavonic vessels
arrived, and arrive still. The quay is a very broad
one, by far the broadest in Venice, paved with flagstones,
and teeming with every characteristic form
of Venetian life from early morning till late into the
night.</p>

<p>There are two or three hotels frequented by
foreigners on the Riva, for the situation facing the
open lagoon is an exceptionally good one; and there
are three or four caffès at which the cosmopolitan
and not too aristocratic visitor may get an excellent
cup of coffee (for the Venetians, thanks to their long
connection with the East, know what coffee is, and
will not take chicory or other such detestable substitutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
in lieu of it) for the modest charge of thirteen
centimes—just over one penny—and study as he
drinks it the moving and ever-amusing scenes enacted
before his eyes. His neighbour, perhaps, will be an
old gentleman, the very type of the old ‘pantaloon,’
whose mask was in the old comedy supposed to be
the impersonation of Venice. There are the long,
slender, and rather delicately cut features, terminating
in a long, narrow, and somewhat protruding chin;
the high cheek-bones, the lank and sunken cheeks,
the high nose, the dark bright eye under its bushy
brow. He is very thin, very seedy, and evidently
<em>very</em> poor. But he salutes you, as you take your seat
beside him, with the air of an ex-member of ‘The
Ten’; his ancient hat and napless coat are carefully
brushed; his outrageously high shirt-collar and
voluminous unstarched neckcloth, after the fashion
of a former generation, though as yellow as saffron,
are clean; and his poor old boots as irreproachable
as blacking—which can do much, but, alas! not all
things—can make them. His expenditure of a penny
will entitle him not only to a cup of coffee, as aforesaid,
but also to a glass of fresh water, which has
been turned to an opaline colour by the shaking into
it of a few drops of something which the waiter drops
from a bottle with some contrivance at its mouth,
the effect of which is to cause only a drop or two of
the liquor, whatever it may be, to come out at each
shake. Our old friend is also entitled, in virtue of
his expenditure, to occupy the chair he sits on for as
many hours as he shall see fit to remain in it. And
after the coffee, which must be drunk while hot, has been
despatched, the sippings of the opaline mixture aforesaid
may be protracted indefinitely while he enjoys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
the cool evening breezes from the lagoon, the perfection
of <i lang="it">dolce far niente</i>, and the amusement the life
of the Riva never fails to afford him....</p>

<p>Presently a middle-aged woman and a girl of some
fourteen years station themselves in front of the
audience seated outside the caffè. The elder woman
has a guitar, and the girl a violin and some sheets of
music in her hand. The woman has her wonderful
wealth of black hair grandly dressed, and as shining
as oil can make it. She has large gilt earrings in her
ears, a heavy coral necklace, and a gaudy-coloured
shawl in good condition. Whatever might be beneath
and below this, is in dark shadow—<i lang="la">et sic melius situm</i>.
She is not starved, however, for, as she prepares to
finger her guitar, she shows a well-nourished and not
ill-formed arm. The young girl has one of those pale
delicate, oval faces so common in Venice; she also
has a good shawl—an amber-coloured one—which
so sets off the olive-coloured complexion of her face
as to make her a perfect picture. This couple do not
in any degree assume an attitude of appealing <i lang="la">ad
misericordiam</i>. They pose themselves <i lang="fr">en artistes</i>.
The girl sets about arranging her music in a businesslike
way, and then they play the well-known air of
‘La Stella Confidente’ the little violinist really playing
remarkably well. Then the elder woman comes
round with a little tin saucer for our contributions.
No slightest word or look of disappointment or displeasure
follows the refusal of those who give nothing.
The saucer is presented to each in turn. I supposed
that the application to Si’or Pantaleone was an
empty form. But no. That retired gentleman could
still find wherewithal to patronize the fine arts, and
dropped a centime—the fifth part of a cent—into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
the dish with the air of a prince bestowing the grand
cross of the Golden Fleece.</p>

<p>Then comes a dealer in ready-made trousers, which
Pantaloon examines curiously and cheapens. Then
a body of men singing part-songs, not badly, but to
some disadvantage, as they utterly ignore the braying
of half a dozen trumpets which are coming along the
Riva in advance of a body of soldiers returning to
some neighbouring barracks. Then there are fruit
sellers and fish sellers and hot-chestnut dealers, and,
most vociferous of all, the cryers of ‘Acqua! acqua!
acqua fresca!’ There, making its way among the
numerous small vessels from Dalmatia, Greece, etc.,
moored to the quay of the Schiavoni, comes a boat
from the Peninsular and Oriental steamer, which
arrived this morning from Alexandria, with four or five
Orientals on board. They come on shore, and proceed
to saunter along the Riva towards the Grand Piazza,
while their dark faces and brightly coloured garments
add an element to the motley scene which is
perfectly in keeping with old Venetian reminiscences.</p>

<a id="p_256"></a>A TOUR ROUND VENICE WITH GOLDONI<br>
</h3>

<p class="center allsmcap">IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> genius of Goldoni, like his character and his life,
was in perfect harmony with his allotted work....
Given the style, no individual could be imagined more
supremely its master: he had the perfect facility of
conception, the perfect ease of execution, the absolute
facility of finish and detail, the immense fecundity
of the providentially sent artist. He was never at a
loss for a subject, and never at a standstill for its
treatment; a moment at a window, a glance round
a drawing-room, a word caught in the street, was
sufficient material for a comedy. The sight of the
dirty grey-beard Armenian goody-seller, snarling out
‘Baggigi, Abaggigi’ over his basket of lollipops near
the clock-tower of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s, produced the delightful
little play, ‘I pettegolezzi delle donne....’</p>

<p>Goldoni was best pleased with the humblest, forming
in this a strange contrast with the French comic
writers; the shopkeepers, ridiculous gullible M. Jourdains
and Sganarelles in the eyes of Molière, never
ceased to be respectable for Goldoni.... This democratic,
domestic Goldoni naturally refused to show us
the effeminate, corrupt Venice of nobles, and spies,
and courtezans, which shameful adventurers like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
Casanova, heaping up all the ordure of their town
and times, have made some of us believe to have
been the sole, the real Venice of the eighteenth century.
But Goldoni has another Venice to show, a
Venice undiscovered by gallant idlers like the Président
de Brosses, or pedantic guide-book makers like
La Lande. Let us follow Goldoni across the Square
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s, heedless of the crowd in mask and
cloak, of the nobles in their silk robes, of the loungers
at the gilded coffee-houses, of the gamblers and painted
women lolling out of windows; let us pass beneath
the belfry where the bronze twins strike the hours in
vain for the idlers and vagabonds who turn day into
night and night into day; and let us thread the network
of narrow little streets of the <i lang="it">Merceria</i>. There,
in those tall dark houses, with their dingy look-out on
to narrow canals floating wisps of straw, or on to
dreary little treeless, grassless squares, in those houses
is the real wealth, the real honour, the real good of
Venice; there, and not in the palaces of the Grand
Canal, still lingers something of the spirit and the
habits of the early merchant princes. Merchant princes
no longer, alas! only shopkeepers and brokers, but
thrifty, frugal, patriarchal as in olden days, the descendants
of the great Pantalone de’ Bisognosi, once clothed
in scarlet-lined robe and pointed cap, now dressed
austerely in black, without hair-powder, gold lace,
swords, or scarlet cloaks; active, honest, gruff, and
puritanical.... Let us follow Goldoni yet further
from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s to the distant wharves, to the remoter
canals and <i lang="it">campieli</i>, to the further islands of the
archipelago of Venice, and he will show us all that
remains of the force of the city, of the savage simplicity
and austerity of the boatmen, and fishers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
working classes. There are the gondoliers, forming
a link between the artisans and the seamen—a strange,
Janus-like class which Goldoni loved to depict: servants
of the upper classes, devoted, faithful, and pliant;
steering along with equal indifference, political conspiracy,
household corruption ... beneath the black,
tasselled roof of their boats; witnesses of all the most
secret life of the nobles and merchants, and, while
on their prow, mute and cynical; but, once on shore,
independent, arrogant, despising the indoor servants,
contemptuous towards their masters, whose secrets
they possess, frugal and austere at home, jealous and
revengeful among each other. Goldoni has shown us
the gondoliers seated on the slimy steps by their
moored boats, exchanging witticism on witticism,
criticizing the performances at the theatre, discussing
city life with ineffable arrogance: he has
shown them coming along the Grand Canal, chanting
the flight of Erminia through the ancient forest; he
has shown them, again, quarrelling in the narrow
twisting canals, each refusing to make way for another,
yelling and cursing, forcing their passengers to alight
in terror, and then pursuing each other with their
oars and their short, sharp <i lang="it">tatare</i> daggers. The gondoliers,
besides being good comic stuff for Goldoni, were
an influential part of his audience, and had to be
propitiated by being shown on the stage in all their
originality and waywardness. The gondoliers lived,
when off their boats, among a savage population of
ferrymen, bargees, and fishers; poor, violent, and
austere, whose daughters had at once the freedom of
speech and strength of action of amazons, and the
purity—nay prudery—of nuns: large-limbed, sunburnt,
barefoot creatures, with the golden tints of hair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
and cheek of Titian and Palma, with the dark, savage
eyes of an animal, with the arms of an athlete and
the language of a trooper, of whom Goldoni has
painted a magnificent portrait, idealized but intensely
real, in his Bettina....</p>

<p>Let us call Goldoni’s favourite gondolier, the rough
and caustic Menego Cainello, and bid him steer us
through the last canals, among the remotest Venetian
islands, leaving the towers of Venice behind us; bid
him row us across the shallow open lagoon, with its
vast, snake-like rows of sea-corroded posts, its stunted
marine reeds, and its tangled sea-grass waving lazily
on the rippled water; row on till we get to that tiny
other Venice, still perhaps like the greater Venice in
the days of her earliest Doges, to the little fishing-town
of Chiozza. There, in the port, Goldoni will
show us the heavy fishing-boat, grimy and oozy, just
returned from a week’s cruise in the Adriatic, with
her yellow sail, emblazoned with the winged lion,
leisurely flapping, and her briny nets over her sides;
the master of the boat, Paron Fortunato, is shouting
in unintelligible dialect, Venetian further insularized
into Chiozzot, and Chiozzot rarefied on sea into some
strange nautical lisping jargon; the rest of the fishermen,
Tita-Nane, and Menegheto, and Tonì, are
collecting the fish they have brought into baskets,
reserving the finest for His Excellency the Governor
of Chiozza. And, when the fish are disposed of, follow
we the fishermen to the main street of the little town,
where, facing the beach, their wives, daughters, and
sisters sit making lace on their cushions, chattering
like magpies; some eating, others holding disdainfully
aloof from the baked pumpkin with which the
gallant peasant Toffolo Marmottina regales them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
Suddenly a tremendous gabble begins, gabble turning
into shrieking and roaring, and upsetting of chairs
and cushions; and a torrent of abuse streams forth
in dialect, and all is lost in scuffling confusion; the
men come up, seize sticks, daggers, and stones, and
rush to the rescue of their female relatives, till the
police hasten up and separate the combatants. Then
let us watch the recriminations of the lovers, hear
them accusing each other of perfidy, calling each other
dog, assassin, beggar, ginger-bread, jewel, pig, all in
turns; clinging and nudging, weeping and roaring,
till at length the good-natured little Venetian magistrate
of Chiozza, contemptuously called ‘Mr. Wig-of-Tow’
(<i lang="it">Sior paruca de stopa</i>), makes up all the quarrels,
bids the innkeeper send wine and pumpkins and
delicious fried things, and, after regaling the pacified
Chiozzoti and Chiozzote, calls for fiddles and invites
them all to dance some <i lang="it">furlane</i>. Is it reality? Has
Menego rowed us over the lagoon? Have we seen
the ship come in and the fish put in baskets? Have
we seen the women at their lace cushions? Have we
heard that storm of cries, and shrieks, and clatter,
and scuffling feet? Have we really witnessed this
incident of fishing life on the Adriatic? No; we have
only laid down a little musty volume at the place
marked ‘Le Baruffe Chiozzotte.’</p>

<h3 class="break">A VENETIAN CARNIVAL<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Little</span> golden cloudlets, like winged living creatures,
were hanging up in the rosy glow above Santa Maria
della Salute, and all along the Grand Canal the
crowded gondolas were floating in a golden haze, and all
the westward-facing palace windows flashed and shone
with an illumination which the lamps and lanterns
that were to be lighted after sundown could never
equal, burnt they never so merrily. It was Shrove
Tuesday in Venice, Carnival time. The sun had been
shining on the city and on the lagoons all day long.

hum of joyous, foolish voices echoed from those palace
façades, and floated out seaward, and rang along the
narrow calle, and drifted on the winding waterways,
and resounded under the innumerable bridges; for
everywhere in the City by the Sea men, women, and
children were making merry, and had given themselves
up to a wild and childish rapture of unreasoning
mirth, ready to explode into loud laughter at the
sorriest jokes. An old man tapped upon the shoulder
by a swinging paper lantern—a boy whose hat had
been knocked off—a woman calling to her husband
or her lover across the gay flotilla—anything was
food for mirth on this holiday evening, while the great
gold orb sank in the silvery lagoon, and all the sky
over yonder Chioggia was dyed with the crimson afterglow,
and the Chioggian fishing-boats were moving
westward in all the splendour of their painted sails.</p>

THREE VENETIAN FEASTS<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I was</span> at three very solemne feasts in Venice; I meane
not commessations or banquets, but holy and religious
solemnities, whereof the first was in the Church of
certaine Nunnes in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Laurence parish.... This
was celebrated the one and thirtieth of July, being
Sunday, where I heard much singular musicke. The
second was on the day of our Ladies assumption,
which was the fifth of August, being Fryday, that day
in the morning I saw the Duke in some of his richest
ornaments, accompanyed with twenty-sixe couple of
Senators, in their damaske long-sleeved gownes, come
to Sainte Marks. Also there were Venetian Knights
and Ambassadors, that gave attendance upon him,
and the first that went before him on the right hand,
carried a naked sword in his hand. He himselfe then
wore two very rich robes or long garments, whereof
the uppermost was white, of cloth of silver, with great
massy buttons of gold, the other cloth of silver also,
but adorned with many curious workes made in
colours with needle worke. His traine was then
holden up by two Gentlemen. At that time I heard
much good musicke in Sainte Markes Church, but
especially that of a treble voill which was so excellent,
that I thinke no man could surpasse it. Also there
were sagbuts and cornets as at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Laurence feast
which yeelded passing good musicke. The third
feast was upon Saint Roches day, being Saturday and
the sixth day of August, where I heard the best
musicke that ever I did in all my life both in the
morning and the afternoone, so good that I would
willingly goe an hundred miles a foote at any time to
heare the like. The place where it was, is neare to
Saint Roches Church, a very sumptuous and magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
building that belongeth to one of the sixe
Companies of the citie.... This building hath a
marvailous rich and stately frontispice, being built
with passing fair white stone, and adorned with
many goodly pillars of marble. There are three
most beautiful roomes in this building; the first is
the lowest, which hath two rowes of goodly pillars
in it opposite to each other which upon this day of
Saint Roch were adorned with many faire pictures of
great personages that hanged round about them, as
of Emperours, Kings, Queenes, Dukes, Duchesses,
Popes, etc. In this roome are two or three faire
Altars: For this roome is not appointed for merriments
and banquetings as the halles belonging to the
Companies of London, but altogether for devotion
and religion.... The second is very spacious and
large, having two or three faire Altars more: the
roofe of this roome, which is of a stately height, is
richly gilt and decked with many sumptuous embossings
of gold, and the walles are beautified with
sundry delicate pictures, as also many parts of the
roofe; unto this room you must ascend by two or
three very goodly paire of staires. The third roome
which is made at one corner of this spacious roome, is
very beautifull, having both roofe and wals something
correspondent to the other; but the floore is
much more exquisite and curious, being excellently
distinguished with checker worke made of several
kinds of marble, which are put in by the rarest cunning
that the wit of man can devise. The second
roome is the place where this festivitie was solemnized
to the honour of Saint Roch, at one end whereof
was an altar garnished with many singular ornaments,
but especially with a great multitude of silver candlesticks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
in number sixty, and candles in them of virgin
waxe. This feast consisted principally of Musicke,
which was both vocall and instrumental, so good, so
delectable, so rare, so admirable, so superexcellent,
that it did even ravish and stupifie all those strangers
that never heard the like. But how others were
affected with it I know not; for mine owne part I can
say this, that I was for the time even rapt up with
Saint Paul into the third heaven. Sometimes there
sung sixeteene or twenty men together, having their
master or moderator to keepe them in order; and
when they sung, the instrumentall musitians played
also. Sometimes sixeteene played together upon their
instruments, ten Sagbuts, foure Cornets, and two
Violdegambaes of an extraordinary greatness; sometimes
tenne, sixe Sagbuts and foure Cornets; sometimes
two, a Cornet and treble violl. Of those treble viols
I heard three severall there, whereof each was so good,
especially one, that I observed above the rest, that I
never heard the like before. Those that played upon
the treble viols, sung and played together, and sometimes
two singular fellowes played together upon
Theorboes, to which they sung also, who yeelded
admirable sweet musicke, but so still that they could
scarce be heard but by those that were very neare
them. Those two Theorbists concluded that night’s
musicke, which continued three whole howers at the
least. For they beganne about five of the clocke
and ended not before eight. Also it continued as long
in the morning: at every time that every severall
musicke played, the Organs, whereof there are seven
faire paire in that room, standing all in a rowe together,
plaied with them. Of the singers there were
three or foure so excellent that I thinke few or none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
in Christendome do excell them, especially one, who
had such a peerelesse and (as I may in a manner say)
such a supernaturall voice for such a privilege for the
sweetnesse of his voice, as sweetnesse, that I think
there was never a better singer in all the world, insomuch
that he did not onely give the most pleasant
contentment that could be imagined, to all the
hearers, but also did as it were astonish and amaze
them.... Truely I thinke that had a Nightingale
beene in the same roome, and contended with him for
the superioritie, something perhaps he might excell
him, because God hath granted that little birde such
a priviledge for the sweetnesse of his voice, as to none
other: but I thinke he could not much. To conclude,
I attribute so much to this rare fellow for his singing,
that I thinke the country where he was borne, may
be as proude for breeding so singular a person as
Smyrna was of her Homer, Verona of her Catullus,
or Mantua of Virgil: But exceeding happy may that
Citie, or towne, or person bee that possesseth this
miracle of nature. These musitians had bestowed
upon them by that of Saint Roche an hundred
duckats. Thus much concerning the musicke of those
famous feastes of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Laurence, the Assumption of
our Lady, and Saint Roche.</p>

<a id="p_266"></a>AN IMPROVISATORE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I had</span> now visited the rich Palace of the Doges, had
wandered in the empty, magnificent halls; seen the
chamber of the Inquisition, with the frightful picture
of the torments of hell. I went through a narrow
gallery, over a covered bridge, high upon the roof,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
above the canals on which the gondolas glided: this
is the way from the Doge’s Palace to the prisons of
Venice. This bridge is called the Bridge of Sighs.
Close beside it lie the wells. The light of the lamps
alone from the passage can force its way between the
close iron bars into the uppermost dungeon; and yet
this was a cheerful, airy hall, in comparison with those
which lie lower down, below the swampy cellars,
deeper even than the water outside in the canals;
and yet in these unhappy captives had sighed, and
inscribed their names on the damp walls.</p>

<p>‘Air, air!’ demanded my heart, rent with the
horrors of this place; and, entering the gondola, I
flew with the speed of an arrow from the pale-red old
palace, and from the columns of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Theodoret and
the Venetian lion, forth over the living, green water
to the lagoons and Lido, that I might breathe the
fresh air of the sea,—and I found a churchyard.</p>

<p>Here is the stranger, the Protestant, buried, far
from his native country,—buried upon a little strip
of land among the waves, which day by day seem to
rend away more and more of its small remains. The
billows alone wept. Here often sat the fisherman’s
bride or wife, waiting for the lover or the husband,
who had gone out fishing upon the uncertain sea.
The storm arose, and rested again upon its strong
pinions; and the woman sang Tasso’s songs, and
listened to hear whether the man replied. But Love
gave no return in song; alone she sat there, and looked
out over the silent sea. Then, also, her lips became
silent; her eye saw only the white bones of the dead
in the sand; she heard only the hollow booming of
the billows, whilst night ascended over the dead,
silent Venice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>The dark picture filled my thoughts, my whole
state of mind gave it a strong colouring. Solemn
as a church reminding of graves, and the invisible
saints stood before me the entire scene. Flaminia’s
words resounded in my ear, that the poet, who was
a prophet of God, should endeavour only to express
the glorification of God, and that subjects which
tended to this were of the highest character. The immortal
soul ought to sing of the immortal; the glitter
of the moment changed its play of colour, and
vanished with the instant that gave it birth.... I
silently entered the gondola, which bore me toward
Lido. The great open sea lay before me, and rolled
onward to the shore in long billows. I thought of the
bay of Amalfi.</p>

<p>Just beside me, among sea-grass and stones, sat a
young man sketching, certainly a foreign painter; it
seemed to me that I recognized him. I stepped
nearer, he raised his head, and we knew each other.
It was Poggio, a young Venetian nobleman.</p>

<p>‘Signore,’ exclaimed he, ‘you on Lido! Is it the
beauty of the scene, or,’ added he, ‘some other
beauty, which has brought you so near to the angry
Adriatic?... Such a blue, billowy plain,’ said he,
pointing to the sea, ‘is not to be found in Rome!
The sea is the most beautiful thing on the earth! It
is also the mother of Venus, and,’ added he, laughing,
‘is the widow of all the mighty Doges of Venice.’</p>

<p>‘The Venetians must especially love the sea,’ said
I, ‘regarding it as their grandparent, who carried
them and played with them for the sake of her
beautiful daughter Venetia.’</p>

<p>‘She is no longer beautiful now; she bows her
head,’ he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
‘But yet,’ said I, ‘she is still happy under her
sway of the Emperor Francis.’</p>

<p>‘It is a prouder thing to be queen upon the sea
than a Caryatide upon land,’ returned he. ‘The
Venetians have nothing to complain about, and
politics are what I do not understand, but beauty, on
the contrary, I do; and if you are a patron of it, as
I do not doubt but you are, see, here comes my landlady’s
handsome daughter, and inquires whether you
will take part in my frugal dinner.’</p>

<p>We went into the little house close by the shore.
The wine was good, and Poggio most charming and
entertaining....</p>

<p>‘You do not sing?’ asked the lady of the house
from me, when we had done.</p>

<p>‘I will have the honour to improvise before you,’
said I, as a thought entered my mind.</p>

<p>‘He is an improvisatore,’ I heard whispered
around me. The eyes of the ladies sparkled; the
gentlemen bowed. I took a guitar, and begged
them to give me a subject.</p>

<p>‘Venice!’ cried a lady, looking boldly into my eyes.</p>

<p>‘Venice!’ repeated the young gentlemen, ‘because
the ladies are handsome!’</p>

<p>I touched a few chords; described the pomp and
glory of Venice in the days of her greatness, as I had
read about it, and as my imagination had dreamed
of its being, and all eyes flashed; they fancied that it
was so now. I sang about the beauty in the balcony
in the moonlight night, and every lady imagined I
meant it for her, and clapped her hands in applause....
I sang about the proud sea,—the bridegroom of
Venice; about the sons of the sea,—the bold mariners
and fishermen in their little boats. I described a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
storm; the wife’s and the bride’s longing and anxiety;
described that which I myself had seen; the children
who had let fall the holy crucifix, and clung to their
mothers, and the old fisherman who kissed the feet
of the Redeemer.... And now my heart was wonderously
light; the empty canals of Venice and the
old palaces seemed to me beautiful—a sleeping fairy
world.</p>

<a id="p_270"></a>VENICE AND HER CHILDREN<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Though</span> Orio had quadrupled the sum he had desired,
all the treasures of the world were nothing to him
without a Venice to spend them in. At that time
love of country was a passion so strong, so powerful,
that it influenced all hearts, the vilest as well as the
noblest. And truly there was little merit in loving
Venice then,—she was so beautiful, so powerful, so
gay! She was such a bountiful mother to all her
children; such a delightful lover of their glory!
Venice gave such caresses to her triumphant warriors,
such glowing praise for their bravery, such elegant
and noble rewards for their prudence, such rare
pleasures to recompense their slightest services!
Nowhere else could one find such splendid feasts,
enjoy such luxurious idleness, or plunge at will, to-day
in a whirlwind of pleasure, to-morrow in voluptuous
repose. Venice was the most beautiful city of
Europe; the most corrupted and the most virtuous.
The righteous could there be always good, the vicious
always bad. It had sunshine for some, shade for
others. While there were wise institutions and touching
ceremonies to proclaim noble actions, there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
also caves, inquisitors and executioners, to maintain
order and subdue dangerous passions. There were
days of triumph and ovation for the virtuous, and
nights of debauchery and excess for the vicious: and
in no other part of the world were ovations so exciting,
excesses so poetical. Venice was the natural
country for all strong minds, good or evil. It was
the undeniable fatherland of all who knew it.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I like</span> this place extremely, and am of opinion you
would do so too: as to cheapness, I think ’tis impossible
to find any part of Europe where both the laws
and customs are so contrived purposely to avoid
expenses of all sorts; and here is a universal liberty
that is certainly one of the greatest <i lang="fr">agrémens</i> in life.
We have foreign ambassadors from all parts of the
world, who have all visited me. I have received visits
from many of the noble Venetian ladies; and upon
the whole I am very much at my ease here. If I
was writing to Lady Sophia, I would tell her of the
comedies and operas which are every night, at very
low prices; but I believe even you will agree with me
that they are ordered to be as convenient as possible,
every mortal going in a mask, and consequently no
trouble in dressing, or forms of any kind....</p>


<p class="p2 right1 small">
<span class="smcap">Venice</span>, <i><abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 14, 1739</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>I find myself very well here. I am visited by the
most considerable people of the town, and all the
foreign ministers, who have most of them made great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
entertainments for me. I dined yesterday at the
Spanish Ambassador’s, who even surpassed the
French in magnificence. He met me at the hall-door,
and the lady at the stair-head, to conduct me
through the long apartment; in short, they could
not have shown me more honours, if I had been an
ambassadress. She desired me to think myself
<i lang="it">patrona del casa</i>, and offered me all the services in
her power, to wait on me where I pleased, etc. They
have the finest palace in Venice. What is very convenient,
I hear it is not at all expected I should
make any dinners, it not being the fashion for anybody
to do it here but the foreign ministers; and I find
I can live here very genteelly on my allowance. I have
already a very agreeable general acquaintance; though
when I came, here was no one I had ever seen in my
life, but the Cavaliere Grimani and the Abbé Conti.
I must do them justice to say they have taken pains
to be obliging to me. The Procurator brought his
niece (who is at the head of his family) to wait on
me; and they invited me to reside with them at their
palace on the Brent, but I did not think it proper to
accept of it. He also introduced to me the Signora
Pisani Mocenigo, who is the most considerable lady
here. The Nuncio is particularly civil to me; he has
been several times to see me, and has offered me the
use of his box at the opera....</p>


<p class="p2 right1 small">
<span class="smcap">Venice</span>, <i><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 6, 1739</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>Upon my word, I have spoken my real thoughts
in relation to Venice; but I will be more particular
in my description, lest you should find the same
reason of complaint you have hitherto experienced.
It is impossible to give any rule for the agreeableness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
of conversation; but here is so great a variety, I
think ’tis impossible not to find some to suit every
taste. Here are foreign ministers from all parts of
the world, who, as they have no court to employ their
hours, are overjoyed to enter into commerce with
any stranger of distinction. As I am the only lady
here at present, I can assure you I am courted, as if
I was the only one in the world. As to all the conveniences
of life, they are to be had at very easy
rates; and for those that love public places, here are
two playhouses and two operas constantly performed
every night, at exceeding low prices. But you will
have no reason to examine that article, no more than
myself; all the ambassadors having boxes appointed
them; and I have every one of their keys at my
service, not only for my own person, but whoever I
please to carry or send. I do not make much use of
this privilege, to their great astonishment. It is the
fashion for the greatest ladies to walk the streets,
which are admirably paved; and a mask, price sixpence,
with a little cloak, and the head of a domino,
the genteel dress to carry you everywhere. The
greatest equipage is a gondola, that holds eight
persons, and is the price of an English chair. And it is
so much the established fashion for everybody to
live their own way, that nothing is more ridiculous
than censuring the actions of another. This would
be terrible in London, where we have little other
diversion; but for me, who never found any pleasure
in malice, I bless my destiny that has conducted me
to a part where people are better employed than in
talking of the affairs of their acquaintance. It is at
present excessive cold (which is the only thing I have
to find fault with); but in recompense we have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
clear bright sun, and fogs and factions things unheard
of in this climate....</p>


<p class="p2 right1 small">
<span class="smcap">Venice</span>, <i>June 1, 1740</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>You seem to mention the regatta in a manner as
if you would be pleased with a description of it. It
is a race of boats: they are accompanied by vessels
which they call Piotes, and Bichones, that are built
at the expense of nobles and strangers that have a
mind to display their magnificence; they are a sort
of machines adorned with all that sculpture and
gilding can do to make a shining appearance. Several
of them cost one thousand pounds sterling, and I
believe none less than five hundred; they are rowed
by gondoliers dressed in rich habits, suitable to what
they represent. There was enough of them to look
like a little fleet, and I own I never saw a finer sight.
It would be too long to describe every one in particular;
I shall only name the principal:—the
Signora Pisani Mocenigo’s represented the Chariot of
the Night, drawn by four sea-horses, and showing
the rising of the moon, accompanied with stars, the
statues on each side representing the hours to the
number of twenty-four, rowed by gondoliers in rich
liveries, which were changed three times, all of equal
richness, and the decorations changed also to the
dawn of Aurora and the midday sun, the statues
being new dressed every time, the first in green, the
second time in red, and the last blue, all equally laced
with silver, there being three races. Signor Soranzo
represented the Kingdom of Poland, with all the
provinces and rivers in that dominion, with a concert
of the best instrumental music in rich Polish habits;
the painting and gilding were exquisite in their kinds;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
Signor Contarini’s piote showed the Liberal Arts;
Apollo was seated on the stern upon Mount Parnassus,
Pegasus behind, and the Muses seated round him:
opposite was a figure representing Painting, with
Fame blowing her trumpet; and on each side Sculpture,
and Music in their proper dresses. The procurator
Foscarini’s was the Chariot of Flora guided
by Cupids, and adorned with all sorts of flowers,
rose-trees, etc. Signor Julio Contarini’s represented
the Triumphs of Valour; Victory was on the stern,
and all the ornaments warlike trophies of every kind.
Signor Correri’s was the Adriatic Sea receiving into
her arms the Hope of Saxony. Signor Alvisio
Mocenigo’s was the Garden of Hesperides; the whole
fable was represented by different statues. Signor
Querini had the Chariot of Venus drawn by doves,
so well done, they seemed ready to fly upon the
water; the Loves and Graces attended her. Signor
Paul Doria had the Chariot of Diana, who appeared
hunting in a large wood: the trees, hounds, stag, and
nymphs, all done naturally: the gondoliers dressed
like peasants attending the chase: and Endymion,
lying under a large tree, gazing on the goddess.
Signor Angelo Labbia represented Poland crowning
of Saxony, waited on by the Virtues and subject
Provinces. Signor Angelo Molino was Neptune
waited on by the Rivers. Signor Vicenzo Morosini’s
piote showed the Triumphs of Peace; Discord being
chained at her feet, and she surrounded with the
Pleasures, etc....</p>

<p>I must say one word of the bichonis, which are less
vessels, quite open, some representing gardens, others
apartments, all the oars being gilt either with gold
or silver, and the gondolier’s liveries either velvet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
or rich silk, with a profusion of lace, fringe, and
embroidery. I saw this show at the Procurator
Grimani’s house, which was near the place where the
prizes were delivered: there was a great assembly
invited on the same occasion, which were all nobly
entertained.</p>

<p>Venice is the finest city in the world. What could we wish
for better than its Moorish architecture in white marble in
the midst of the limpid waters, and under a sky truly magnificent;
its people so gay, so heedless, so witty, and fond of
its music; its gondolas, churches, and picture galleries; those
good-looking and elegant women; the murmurs of the sea
breaking upon the ear; the moonlights nowhere else to be
seen; choruses of gondoliers, sometimes very correct, serenading
under every window; cafés full of Turks and Armenians;
fine and spacious theatres where you can hear Pasta and
Donzelli; gorgeous palaces; a Punch and Judy show far
above that of Gustave Malus; delicious oysters, which you
can gather on the steps of every house; Cyprian wine at
twenty-five <i lang="fr">sous</i> a bottle; flowers in the heart of winter, and,

<h3>
THE BIRTH OF VENETIAN ART<br>
</h3>
</div><!--end chapter header-->

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Venice</span> ... rose from a lowly and troublous origin
to heights of dazzling grandeur. When the barbarians
of the North began their incursions and devastations
into Italy in the fifth century, the inhabitants of
that part of the Peninsula which was called Venetia
fled from the peril to the islands rising in the lagoons
of the Adriatic, where they found peace, safety, and
liberty.... The inhospitable nature of their new
home provided the refugees with but two elements
only—and those the most indeterminate and universal—sky
and sea. All the rest, all that we see to-day,
has been artificially formed by the hand of man, who
excluded vegetation, animals, every semblance of
living things, and created for himself a world of stone,
a landscape of architecture, and perspective. He has
willed that this shall of itself be beautiful, not from
any assistance from Nature, but by force of art and
riches; not a collection of monuments, but one single
monument in itself, and that so sublime and lasting
as to admit of no comparison. The marvel which
here strikes the spectator has no other example, for
Venice is altogether the work of human art. An art,
too, which is both poetry and history, and when we
think of the history of those Venetians who became
lords of a mighty commerce and conquerors of
provinces, we see, as by an invincible law spreading
out before our imagination, the marble mansions
around the Piazza and along the Grand Canal; we
see through the streets of the city a people proud of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
the wisdom of their statesmen and of the creations
of their painters; we think of the golden Basilica, of
the Palace of the Doges; we evoke the shapes of
Titian, of Paolo Veronese, of Tintoretto.... The
art of painting arose in Italy in the Trecento. This
art, of slower growth than either architecture or
sculpture in Venice, only flourished there well on in
the fifteenth century. It must not, however, be
concluded from this that painting was unknown in
the early days of Venetian life, for leaving aside the
question as to whether the first mosaicists were
Byzantines or Venetians, it is certain that the art
of colours was displayed with admirable feeling in
the mosaics of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s. In the Basilica, which
lifts itself to heaven like a sublime hymn and blends
in divine fulness Greek harmony with Eastern
splendour, may be found the school of Venetian
painters, the source of their inspiration, the golden
book wherein is entered the pedigree of Venetian art.
The colours sparkle, flash, and throw lightning
gleams on to that building bright with matchless
beauty. Mind and eye are alike filled with amazement
and admiration at the sight of the many-hued
marbles, the mosaics, and the gold flung round in
regal profusion. Thus, in this atmosphere of light,
like a serene flower, Venetian painting arose, warm
and vivid in colour even when cold and lifeless in
expression.</p>

<a id="p_281"></a>GIORGIONE’S HOME<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Born</span> half-way between the mountains and the sea—that
young George of Castelfranco—of the Brave
Castle: Stout George they called him, George of
Georges, so goodly a boy he was—Giorgione.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought what a world his eyes
opened on—fair, searching eyes of youth? What a
world of mighty life, from those mountain roots to
the shore—of loveliest life, when he went down, yet
so young, to the marble city—and became himself
as a fiery heart to it?</p>

<p>A city of marble, did I say? Nay, rather a golden
city, paved with emerald. For truly, every pinnacle
and turret glanced or glowed, overlaid with gold, or
bossed with jasper. Beneath, the unsullied sea drew
in deep breathing, to and fro, its eddies of green
wave. Deep-hearted, majestic, terrible as the sea,—the
men of Venice moved in sway of power and war;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
pure as her pillars of alabaster, stood her mothers
and maidens; from foot to brow, all noble, walked
her knights; the low bronzed gleaming of sea-rusted
armour shot angrily under their blood-red mantle
folds. Fearless, faithful, patient, impenetrable, implacable—every
word a fate—sat her senate. In
hope and honour, lulled by flowing of wave around
their isles of sacred sand, each with his name written
and the cross graved at his side, lay her dead. A
wonderful piece of world. Rather, itself a world. It
lay along the face of the waters, no larger, as its
captains saw it from their masts at evening, than a
bar of sunset that could not pass away; but for its
power, it must have seemed to them as if they were
sailing in the expanse of heaven, and this a great
planet, whose orient edge widened through ether.
A world from which all ignoble care and petty
thoughts were banished, with all the common and
poor elements of life. No foulness, nor tumult, in
those tremulous streets, that filled, or fell, beneath
the moon; but rippled music of majestic change, or
thrilling silence. No weak walls could rise above
them; no low-roofed cottage, nor straw-built shed.
Only the strength as of rock, and the finished setting of
stones most precious. And around them, far as the
eye could reach, still the soft moving of stainless
waters, proudly pure; as not the flower, so neither
the thorn nor the thistle could grow in the glancing
fields. Ethereal strength of Alps, dream-like, vanishing
in high procession beyond the Torcellan shore;
blue islands of Paduan hills, poised in the golden
west. Above, free winds and fiery clouds ranging at
their will—brightness out of the north, and balm
from the south, and the stars of the evening and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
morning clear in the limitless light of arched heaven
and circling sea....</p>

<p>I do not find in Giorgione’s work any of the early
Venetian monachist element. He seems to me to
have belonged more to an abstract contemplative
school. I may be wrong in this; it is no matter;
suppose it were so, and that he came down to Venice
somewhat recusant, or insentient, concerning the
usual priestly doctrines of his day, how would the
Venetian religion, from an outer intellectual standing-point,
have <em>looked</em> to him?</p>

<p>He would have seen it to be a religion indisputably
powerful in human affairs; often very harmfully so;
sometimes devouring widows’ houses, and consuming
the strongest and fairest from among the young;
freezing into merciless bigotry the pokey of the old:
also, on the other hand, animating national courage,
and raising souls, otherwise sordid, into heroism: on
the whole, always a real and great power; served with
daily sacrifice of gold, time, and thought; putting
forth its claims, if hypocritically, at least in bold
hypocrisy, not waiving any atom of them in doubt or
fear; and, assuredly, in large measure, sincere, believing
in itself, and believed: a goodly system, moreover,
in aspect; gorgeous, harmonious, mysterious—a
thing which had either to be obeyed or combated,
but could not be scorned. A religion towering over
all the city—many buttressed—luminous in marble
stateliness, as the dome of our Lady of Safety shines
over the sea; many-voiced also, giving, over all the
eastern seas, to the sentinel his watchword, to the
soldier his war-cry; and, on the lips of all who died
for Venice, shaping the whisper of death.</p>

<a id="p_285"></a>TITIAN AT VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Titian</span> was born in the little town of Cadore, on
the Piave, five miles from the Alps. He sprang
from the family of the Vecelli, one of the most noble
of those parts; and when he reached the age of ten
years, showing a fine spirit and quickness of mind,
he was sent to Venice to the house of one of his uncles,
an honoured citizen. He, seeing that the boy was
much inclined to painting, put him with the famous
painter Gian Bellini, under whose discipline he studied
drawing, and showed himself in a short time to be
endowed by nature with all that was necessary for
the art of painting. Gian Bellini and the other
painters of that country, having no knowledge of
ancient art, were accustomed mostly, in fact entirely,
to draw from life, though in a dry, crude manner.
Titian therefore learnt in this way. But when
Giorgione da Castelfranco came, the manner of working
did not altogether please him, and he began to
give his works more softness and greater relief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
following Nature indeed, and imitating her as well as
he could in colour, but not making any drawing,
holding firmly that painting in colours without
studying the drawing in a cartoon was the true and
best way of working. Titian, then, seeing Giorgione’s
method, left Gian Bellini’s manner and adopted the
new way, imitating it so well that his pictures were
mistaken for the works of Giorgione. And when
Giorgione was employed upon the façade of the
German Exchange a part was given to Titian. Some
gentlemen, not knowing that Giorgione had ceased
to work there, and that Titian was employed upon it,
meeting Giorgione one day, began to congratulate
him, saying he was doing better on this façade than
he had done on that one on the Grand Canal. And
this vexed Giorgione so much that until the work
was finished, and it was known that Titian had done
that part, he would not be seen, and from that time
he would not let Titian work with him or be his
friend....</p>

<p>Giovanni Bellini left unfinished at his death the
picture, in the hall of the Great Council, of Barbarossa
kneeling before Pope Alexander <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> Titian
completed it, altering many things, and introducing
many portraits of his friends and others. For this
he obtained from the Signory an office which is called
the Senseria, which brings in three hundred crowns a
year. This office has usually been given to the best
painter of that city, with the duty of painting from
time to time their Prince or Doge, at the price of
eight crowns only, paid them by this prince, and this
portrait is afterwards placed in his memory in the
palace of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s.</p>

<p>The Duke Alfonso of Ferrara had engaged Giovanni<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
Bellini to paint a picture for a room in his palace, but
he had been unable to complete it on account of his
age, and Titian therefore was summoned to finish it,
and for this prince he painted several things, and was
liberally rewarded by him. At this time he formed
a friendship with the divine Ludovico Ariosto, who
celebrated him in his ‘Orlando Furioso.’</p>

<p>After his return to Venice he painted many pictures
for the churches, and among others for the church
of S. Rocco he painted Christ bearing the Cross.
This, which many have supposed to be from Giorgione’s
hand, has become the chief object of devotion
in Venice, and has received in alms more crowns than
Titian and Giorgione earned in their whole life....
For the Church of S. Giovanni and S. Paolo he painted
an altarpiece representing S. Peter Martyr in a wood
of high trees, struck down by a fierce soldier, who has
wounded him in the head, and as he lies but half
alive you can see in his face the horror of death,
while another friar fleeing shows signs of fear. In
the sky are two angels coming in the light of heaven,
which lights up a beautiful landscape. The work is
the most finished one that Titian ever did....</p>

<p>There is no lord of note or prince or great lady
who has not been painted by Titian; and, besides, at
different times, he produced many other works.</p>

<p>It is true that his way of working in his last pictures
is very different from that of his youth. For
his first works were finished with great diligence, and
might be looked at near or far, but the last are
worked with great patches of colour, so that they
cannot be seen near, but at a distance they look
perfect. This is the reason that many think they are
done without any trouble, but this is not true. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
this way of working is most judicious, for it makes the
pictures seem living.</p>

<p>All these works, with a great many others, which
cannot be mentioned lest I should become tedious,
he has completed, having now reached the age of
seventy-six. He has been most healthy, and as
fortunate as anyone has ever been. In his house at
Venice he has received all the princes, and learned
and famous men, who have come to Venice; for
besides his excellence in art, his manners have been
most pleasant and courteous. He has had some
rivals, but not very dangerous ones. He has earned
much, for his works have always been well paid;
but it would be well for him, in these his last years,
to work only for pastime, lest he diminish his reputation.</p>

<p>When the present writer was in Venice in 1566,
he went to visit Titian, and found him, old as he
was, with his brush in his hand, painting, and he
found great pleasure in seeing his works and talking
with him.</p>

<p>Thus Titian, having adorned Venice, or rather
Italy, and indeed other parts of the world, with the
finest pictures, deserves to be loved and studied by
artists, and in many things imitated, for he has done
works worthy of infinite praise, which will last as
long as illustrious men are remembered.</p>

<a id="p_288"></a>THE ENCHANTED VOICE OF VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Turner’s</span> imagination dwelt always on three great
cities, Carthage, Rome, and Venice—Carthage in connection
especially with the thoughts and study<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
which led to the painting of the Hesperides’ Garden,
showing the death which attends the vain pursuit of
wealth; Rome, showing the death which attends the
vain pursuit of power; Venice, the death which
attends the vain pursuit of beauty.</p>

<p>How strangely significative, thus understood, those
last Venetian dreams of his become, themselves so
beautiful and so frail; wrecks of all that they were
once—twilights of twilight!</p>

<p>Vain beauty; yet not all in vain. Unlike in birth,
how like in their labour, and their power over the
future, these masters of England and Venice—Turner
and Giorgione. But ten years ago I saw the last
traces of the greatest works of Giorgione yet glowing,
like a scarlet cloud, on the Fondaco de Tedeschi.
And though that scarlet cloud (sanguigna e fiammeggiante,
per cui le pitture cominciarono con dolce
violenza a rapire il cuore delle genti) may, indeed,
melt away into paleness of night, and Venice herself
waste from her islands as a wreath of wind-driven
foam fades from their weedy beach; that which she
won of faithful light and truth shall never pass away.
Deiphobe of the sea—the Sun God measures her
immortality to her by its sand. Flushed, above the
Avernus of the Adrian lake, her spirit is still seen
holding the golden bough; from the lips of the Sea
Sibyl men shall learn for ages yet to come what is
most noble and most fair; and, far away, as the
whisper in the coils of the shell, withdrawn through
the deep hearts of nations, shall sound for ever the
enchanted voice of Venice.</p>

<a id="p_291"></a>THE SPLENDOUR OF <abbr title="Saint"><span class="smcap">ST.</span></abbr> MARK’S<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> beautifull Church of Saint Marke doth of its
owne accord as it were offer it selfe now to be spoken
of. Which though it be but little, yet it is exceeding
rich, and so sumptuous for the stateliness of the
architecture, that I thinke very few in Christendome
of the bignesse doe surpasse it.... The pavement
of this Church is so passing curious, that I thinke no
Church in Christendome can show the like. For the
pavement of the body of the Church, the Quire, and
the walkes round about before you come within the
body, are made of sundry little pieces of Thasian,
Ophiticall, and Laconicall marble in checker worke,
and other most exquisite conveyances, and those, of
many severall colours, that it is very admirable and
rare to behold, the rarenesse such that it doth even
amaze all strangers upon their first view thereof.
The west front towards <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marks street is most
beautifull, having five severall partitions, unto which
there belong as many brasen dores, whereof the
middle, through which they usually go into the
Church, is made of solid brasse, the other foure in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
forme of latteise windowes. This front is very
stately adorned with beautiful pillars of white marble,
whereof in one part of the front, I told a hundred and
two and fifty, in the higher two and forty. In all one
hundred fourescore and fourteene. Some greater,
some lesser. Some of one colour and some of another.
At the sides of the great gate are eight rich pillars
of porphyrie, foure in one side, and as many in
another, whereof each would be worth twenty pound
with us in England. Over the toppe of this middle
gate is to be seene a very ancient and remarkable
monument, foure goodly brasen horses made of
Corinthian mettall, and fully as great as the life.
These horses were brought to Venice in the time of
their Duke Petrus Zanus, which was about the yeare
1206. Some say they were cast by Lysippus that
singular statuary of Alexander the Great above three
hundred years before Christ; some say that the
Romans made them at what time Hiero King of
Syracuse triumphed of the Parthians, and placed
them in a certain arch that they dedicated to him.
It is reported that Tyridates King of Armenia bestowed
them on the Emperour Nero, when he was
entertained in Rome with such pompous magnificence,
as is mentioned by Tacitus and Suetonius.
And that Constantine the Great brought them from
Rome to Constantinople, and therehence they were
lastly brought to Venice by the Venetians, when they
possessed Constantinople. At what time they
brought many other notable things from that City,
for the better ornament both of their publique and
private buildings. These horses are advanced on
certain curious and beautifull pillars, to the end they
may be more conspicuous and eminent to be seene of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
every person.... I observed another very memorable
monument within the first great gate, which is
betwixt that gate and the opposite brasen gate at the
going into the body of the Church, which is also made
of massy brasse, namely a great stone formed and
cut according to the fashion of a diamond pavier, in
the middle whereof is made a prety checker worke
garnished with divers little pieces of marble of sundry
colours. On this little worke which is in the middest
of the said stone did Fredericus Barbarossa the
Emperour lay downe his necke as a foote-stoole to
Pope Alexander the third to treade upon it....
Over the gate as you passe into the body of the
Church, is to be seene the picture of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marke (if at
the least a man may properly call such a piece of work
a picture) made most curiously with pieces of marble
(as I conceive it) exceeding little, all gilt over in a
kinde of worke very common in this Church, called
Mosaicall worke. He is made looking up to heaven
with his hands likewise elevated, and that wearing
of a marvailous rich cope, under whom [an inscription]
is written in faire letters.... On the right
hand of the Church as you goe in, even at the south
corner, there is a very faire little Chappel having a
sumptuous Altar that is adorned with a very curious
roofe, and two goodly pillars of Parian marble at the
sides, of wonderfull faire workmanship, wherein are
finely made clusters of grapes, and other borders
exceeding well expressed. At both the endes of the
Altar are made two great lyons in porphyrie, whereof
that on the right hand leaneth a little child, the other
on the left hand on a sheepe.... The pavement of
this Chappel is made of diamond worke with marble
of divers colours, and at the entrance a two leafed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
brasen gate. The inner walles of the Church are
beautified with a great multitude of pictures gilt, and
contrived in Mosaical worke, which is nothing else
but a pretty kind of picturing consisting altogether
of little pieces and very small fragments of gilt
marble, which are square, and halfe as broade as the
naile of a mans finger; of which pieces there concurreth
a very infinite company to the making of
these pictures. I never saw any of this kind of
picturing before I came to Venice, nor ever either
read or heard of it, of which Saint Marks Church is
full in every wall and roofe. It is said that they
imitate the Grecians in these Mosaical workes....
At the west end of the Church in the walke which is
without the body, are three more of those Mosaical
round roofes full of those pictures or effigies as the
other within the Church, and another square, of a
greater height than the rest, wherein is painted the
Crosse of Christ ... foure Angels by the sides of
it: And a little way farther two companies of Angels
more, one on the right hand of the Crosse, and
another on the left, with Lilies in their hands. Againe,
in the north side of the Church wherein is another of
those walkes without the body, are three more of
those Mosaical vaulted roofes full of pictures, which
doe make up the full number. Most of these pictures
have either names, which expresse the same, or Latin
Poesies in verse, or both made by them.... I saw
in the body of the Church a very rich stone called an
Agat, about two foote long, and as broad as the
palme of a mans hand, which is valued at tenne
thousand duckats at the least. This is on the right
hand of the Church as you goe into the Quire from
the West gate. The corners whereof I saw broken;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
which I heard happened by this meanes. A certaine
Jew hid himselfe all night in a corner of this Church,
and when all the gates were locked, he tried to pul up
the stone with pinsers and some other instruments;
but he failed in his enterprise, because the stone was
so fast soldered into the ground that he could not
with his cunning pull it up; being apprehended in
the Church the next morning before he could make an
evasion, he was presently hanged for his labour in
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Markes place....</p>

<p>The high Altar is very faire, but especially that
inestimable rich table heretofore brought from Constantinople,
which is above the Altar: that table
is never shewed but onely upon some speciall feast
day, being most commonly covered by certaine
devices that they have, and another meaner table
standeth usually upon it. This table is the fairest
that ever I saw, which indeed I saw but once onely,
upon the feast of our Ladies assumption, which was
the fifth day of August: it is marvellous richly
wrought in gold, and silver, with many curious little
images, such as we call in Latin imagunculæ or
icunculæ. And the upper part of it most sumptuously
adorned with abundance of pretious stones of great
value that doe exceedingly beautifie the worke. I
think it is worth at least ten thousand pounds.
Over this Altar is a most beautiful concamerated
roofe of rich Ophiticall marble, and supported with
foure passing faire pillars at the corners made of
Parian marble, wherein are very artifically represented
many histories of the old and new Testament.
In this Quire I saw two and twenty goodly Candlestickes,
hanged up with chains, the fairest that ever
I saw. At both sides of it are two exceeding faire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
payre of Organes, whose pipes are silver, especially
those on the left hand as you come in from the body
of the Church, having the brasen winged Lyon of
S. Mark on the top, and the images of two Angels
at the sides.... The last notable thing that is in
the Church ... is the treasure of Saint Marke, kept
in a certaine Chappell in the south side of the Church
neere to the stately porch of the Dukes Palace. But
here methinks I use the figure <i lang="el">hysteron proteron</i>, in
that I conclude my tract of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Markes Church with
that which was worthiest to be spoken of at the
beginning. For this treasure is of that inestimable
value, that it is thought no treasure whatsoever in
any one place of Christendome may compare with
it.... Here they say is kept marveilous abundance
of rich stones of exceeding worth, as Diamonds, Carbuncles,
Emerauds, Chrysolites, Jacinths, and great
pearles of admirable value: also three Unicorns
hornes; an exceeding great Carbuncle which was
bestowed upon the Senate by the Cardinall Grimannus,
and a certaine Pitcher adorned with great
variety of pretious stones, which Usumcassanes King
of Persia bestowed upon the Signiory, with many
other things of wonderful value.</p>

This church is also Gotic; yet for the preciousnese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
of the materials being of severall rich marbles, aboundance
of porphyrie, serpentine, &amp;c. far exceeding any
in Rome, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s hardly excepted. I much admired
the splendid historie of our Saviour, compos’d
all of Mosaic over the faciata, below which and
over the chiefe gate are four horses cast in coper as
big as the life, the same that formerly were transported
from Rome by Constantine to Byzantium, and
thence by the Venetians hither. They are supported
by eight porphyrie columns of very great size and
value. Being come into the Church, you see nothing,
and tread on nothing, but what is precious. The
floore is all inlayed with achats, lazuli’s, calcedons,
jaspers, porphyries and other rich marbles, admirable
also for the work; the walls sumptuously incrusted
and presenting to the imagination the shapes of men,
birds, houses, flowers, and a thousand varieties. The
roofe is of most excellent Mosaic; but what most
persons admire is the new work of the emblematic
tree at the other passage out of the Church. In the
midst of this rich volto rise five cupolas, the middle
very large and susteyn’d by thirty-six marble columns,
eight of which are of precious marbles: under these
cupolas is the high altar, on which is a reliquarie of
severall sorts of jewells, engraven with figures after
the Greeke manner, and set together with plates of
pure gold. The altar is cover’d with a canopy of
ophit, on which is sculptur’d the storie of the Bible
and so on the pillars, which are of Parian marble
that support it. Behind these are four other columns
of transparent and true Oriental alabaster, brought
hither out of the mines of Solomon’s Temple as they
report. There are many chapells and notable monuments
of illustrious persons, Dukes, Cardinals, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
as Zeno, Jo. Soranzi, and others: there is likewise a
vast baptisterie of coper.... In one of the corners lies
the body of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Isidore, brought hither five hundred
years since from the island of Chios.... Going out of
the Church they shew’d us the stone where Alexander
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> trod on the neck of the Emperor Fred.
Barbarossa, pronouncing the verse of the psalm,
‘<i lang="la">Super basiliscum</i>,’ &amp;c. The dores of the Church are
of massie coper. There are neare five hundred
pillars in this building, most of them porphyrie and
serpentine, and brought chiefly from Athens and
other parts of Greece formerly in their power. At
the corner of the Church are inserted into the maine
wall foure figures as big as life cut in porphyrie, which
they say are the images of four brothers who poysoned
one another, by which means there escheated
to the Republiq that vast treasury of relicques now
belonging to the Church. At the other entrance that
looks towards the sea, stands in a small chapell that
statue of our Lady, made (as they affirme) of the same
stone or rock out of which Moses brought water to the
murmuring Israelites at Meriba.... The next day,
by favour of the French Ambassador, I had admittance
with him to see the Reliquary call’d here
Tresoro di San Marco, which very few even of
travellers are admitted to see. It is a large chamber
full of presses. There are twelve breast-plates, or
pieces of pure golden armour studded with precious
stones, and as many crownes dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark
by so many noble Venetians who had recovered their
wives taken at sea by the Saracens; many curious
vases of achats; the cap or cornet of the Dukes of
Venice, one of which had a rubie set on it esteemed

<a id="p_299"></a>THE LEGEND OF <abbr title="Saint"><span class="smcap">ST.</span></abbr> MARK<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the 25th of February, 1340, there fell out a wonderful
thing in this land; for during three days the
waters rose continually, and in the night there was
fearful rain and tempest, such as had never been
heard of. So great was the storm that the waters
rose three cubits higher than had ever been known
in Venice; and an old fisherman being in his little boat
in the canal of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, reached with difficulty the
Riva di San Marco, and there he fastened his boat,
and waited the ceasing of the storm. And it is related
that, at the time this storm was at its highest,
there came an unknown man, and besought him that
he would row him over to San Giorgio Maggiore,
promising to pay him well; and the fisherman replied,
‘How is it possible to go to San Giorgio? We
shall sink by the way!’ but the man only besought
him the more that he should set forth. So, seeing
that it was the will of God, he arose and rowed over
to San Giorgio Maggiore; and the man landed there
and desired the boatman to wait. In a short time
he returned with a young man; and they said, ‘Now
row towards San Niccolò di Lido.’ And the fisherman
said, ‘How can one possibly go so far with one oar?’
and they said, ‘Row boldly, for it shall be possible
with thee, and thou shalt be well paid.’ And he
went; and it appeared to him as if the waters were
smooth. Being arrived at San Niccolò di Lido, the
two men landed, and returned with a third, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
having entered into the boat, they commanded the
fisherman that he should row beyond the two castles.
And the tempest raged continually. Being come to
the open sea, they beheld approaching, with such
terrific speed that it appeared to fly over the waters,
an enormous galley full of demons (as it is written in
the Chronicles, and Marco Sabellino also makes mention
of this miracle): the said barque approached the
castles to overwhelm Venice and to destroy it utterly.
Anon the sea, which had hitherto been tumultuous,
became calm; and these three men, having made the
sign of the cross, exorcised the demons, and commanded
them to depart, and immediately the galley
or the ship vanished. Then these three men commanded
the fisherman to land them, the one at San
Niccolò di Lido, the other at San Giorgio Maggiore,
and the third at San Marco. And when he had
landed the third, the fisherman, notwithstanding the
miracle he had witnessed, desired that he would pay
him, and he replied, ‘Thou art right; go now to the
Doge and to the Procuratore of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, and tell
him what thou hast seen, for Venice would have been
overwhelmed had it not been for us three. I am
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark the Evangelist, the protector of this city;
the other is the brave knight <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George, and he
whom thou didst take up at the Lido is the holy
Bishop <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas. Say to the Doge and to the
Procuratore that they are to pay thee, and tell them
likewise that this tempest rose because of a certain
schoolmaster dwelling at San Felice, who did sell his
soul to the devil, and afterwards hanged himself.’
And the fisherman replied, ‘If I should tell them this,
they would not believe me!’ Then <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark took off
a ring which was worth five ducats, and he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
‘Show them this, and tell them when they look in
the sanctuary they will not find it,’ and thereupon
he disappeared. The next morning, the fisherman
presented himself before the Doge, and related all he
had seen the night before, and showed him the ring
for a sign. And the Procuratore having sent for the
ring, and sought it in the usual place, found it not;
by reason of which miracle the fisherman was paid,
and a solemn procession was ordained, giving thanks
to God, and to the relics of the three holy saints who
rest in our land, and who delivered us from this great
danger. The ring was given to Signor Marco Lordano
and to Signor Andrea Dandolo, the Procuratore,
who placed it in the sanctuary; and, moreover, a
perpetual provision was made for the aged fisherman.</p>

<a id="p_301"></a><abbr title="Saint"><span class="smcap">ST.</span></abbr> GEORGE OF THE GREEKS<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George of the Greeks is one of
Venice’s most wonderful places. One has the impression
of a sanctuary which is at the same time a
treasure-house; gold everywhere—furniture, eikons,
lamps, embroideries—not gilding, but real, heavy
gold. The vestments are stiff with it. The bearded
golden priest goes backwards and forwards, the gold-embroidered
curtains opening and shutting for him,
revealing and hiding a number of tapers and incense
and shining encrusted walls; while the acolytes, in
slender folded linen smocks, with gold stoles crossed
over their backs, kneel before the rood-screen. There
is a sense of the departed splendours of Judaism, of
a Solomon’s Temple behind those half-drawn curtains;
and every time that <em>pope</em> came forth a name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
rose up in my mind—Melchizedek, he who was a
priest and also a king. After that service at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
George’s of the Greeks, we walked home through
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s, entering it by the sacristy. The hot air,
smoke of incense and dust, the shuffle of human
beings and snuffling of priests caught one by the
throat after that fair empty splendour of the Greek
church. Caught me at least, subduing, crushing,
perhaps rumpling my imagination and feelings, but
making them humaner. There is, in this magnificence,
a share of shabbiness; in this venerable place
the sense of the deciduous, the perishable, which,
in a way, is also a sense of the eternal. There
is room, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s solemnity, for such as that
consumptive girl who made head garlands for cemeteries.
And <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s is the greater for her poor
presence.</p>

SUNRISE IN VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> sun rose upon Venice, and presented to me the
city, whose image I had so early acquired. In the
heart of a multitude, there was stillness. I looked
out from the balcony on the crowded quays of yesterday;
one or two idle porters were stretched in sleep
on the scorching pavement, and a solitary gondola
stole over the gleaming waters. This was all.</p>

<p>It was the Villeggiatura, and the absence of the
nobility from the city invested it with an aspect even
more deserted than it would otherwise have exhibited.
I cared not for this. For me, indeed, Venice, silent
and desolate, owned a greater charm than it could
have commanded with all its feeble imitation of the
worthless bustle of a modern metropolis. I congratulated
myself on the choice season of the year in
which I had arrived at this enchanting city. I do not
think that I could have endured to be disturbed by
the frivolous sights and sounds of society, before I
had formed a full acquaintance with all those marvels
of art that command our constant admiration while
gliding about the lost capital of the Doges, and before
I had yielded a free flow to those feelings of poetic
melancholy which swell up in the soul as we contemplate
this memorable theatre of human action,
wherein have been performed so many of man’s most
famous and most graceful deeds.</p>

<p>If I were to assign the particular quality which
conduces to that dreamy and voluptuous existence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
which men of high imagination experience in Venice,
I should describe it as the feeling of abstraction which
is remarkable in that city and peculiar to it. Venice
is the only city which can yield the magical delights of
solitude. All is still and silent. No rude sound disturbs
your reveries; Fancy, therefore, is not put to flight.
No rude sound distracts your self-consciousness. This
renders existence intense. We feel everything. And
we feel thus keenly in a city not only eminently beautiful,
not only abounding in wonderful creations of
art, but each step of which is hallowed ground, quick
with associations that, in their more various nature,
their nearer relation to ourselves, and perhaps their
more picturesque character, exercise a greater influence
over the imagination than the more antique
story of Greece and Rome. We feel all this in a city,
too, which, although her lustre be indeed dimmed, can
still count among her daughters maidens fairer than
the orient pearls with which her warriors once loved
to deck them. Poetry, Tradition, and Love, these
are the graces that have invested with an ever-charming
cestus this Aphrodite of cities.</p>

<a id="p_306"></a>VENICE: NIGHT ILLUSION—MORNING REALITY<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">If</span>, instead of entering Venice by the Adriatic, the
visitor ... crosses at night the long viaduct which
connects the town with the mainland, what a strange
impression he will receive! To glide silently in the
middle of the night over still black waters, to see
glimmering lanterns flitting right and left, to hear the
splash of an oar on the water, to glide between high
banks of architecture, processions of palaces that flit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
by more felt than seen, as in an etching of Piranesi,—to
pass under bridges, hear cries without catching
their meaning, every moment to brush past those
sombre catafalques which are other gondolas gliding
through the darkness as silently as your own,—then,
from time to time, to see as in a flash of lightning the
outline of a figure leaning forward on its oar, a lamp
burning and casting a keen reflection at the corner of
a winding canal, a window brilliantly lighted and
making a flaring hole in the midst of night,—to get
entangled in dark water-lanes, turning, twisting,
moving, without the feeling of movement, and all
at once to land at a staircase which plunges its steps
down into the water, and leads into a large and noble
hall of fine architectural proportions, in a palace
gleaming with lights, full of life and activity, and of
busy men who bring one back after that strange
journey to the commonplaces of hotel life,—this is
certainly the most wonderful of dreams, a sort of
ideal nightmare.</p>

<p>It has scarcely lasted an hour; but you are tired
from a long journey; you soon fall asleep from
weariness, hardly asking yourself, in the first uncertainty
and fatigue, over what Styx you have sailed,
what strange city you have traversed, and whether
you have not been the dupe of a dream. In the
morning you rush out upon the balcony, and there,
amidst dazzling fight and a very debauch of colours,
with a shimmering of pearl and silver, triumphant
upon the waters of her lagoon, you behold that
Venice which you have never seen except in Byron,
in Otway, Musset, and George Sand. She glows,
she sings in silvery radiance; here in very truth is
the Queen of the Adriatic! A pigeon of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
flies over the balcony, throwing its shadow on the flagstones,
and you cherish the long-awaited sight! Here
are the islands, the Arsenal, the Lido, the Mole, the
Redentore, Santa Maria Maggiore, the Ducal Palace,
the gondoliers; in a word, all the city of Canaletto!
But is it not an illusive scene, a phantasmagoria, a
treacherous dream?—if it were but a mirage after all?</p>

<p>And when you begin to wander about the town,
stupefied, dazzled, confused, blinded; when you go
into the museums, the churches; when cradled in
your gondola you pass down that marvellous avenue,
the Grand Canal; when you shall have seen face to
face, in their full glory, Veronese, Tintoret, Vittoria,
the gentle Carpaccio, the Bellini, those sweet and
solemn masters, the Vivarini, the Palmas, the great
Titian, Sansovino, Verocchio, the Lombardi, the
elegant and noble Leopardi, Calendario the rebel,
whose genius did not save him from condign punishment;
when you shall have viewed all these painters,
sculptors, architects, these mighty spirits who, in the
palaces of the Doges, at the Frari, in the Arsenal, at
Santa Maria Formosa, at San Rocco and the Procuratie,
or on either bank of the Grand Canal, have
celebrated the glory of Venice with their gorgeous
palettes, have moulded and carved the bronze and
marble with their puissant hands, have raised to the
sky the clear profiles of the campaniles in their hues
of white and rose, have cast upon the green mirror
of the waters of Canareggio the delicate network of
Gothic palaces, or the sudden projections of classic
entablatures and balconies; after all this, you will
come in worn out, confused, overwhelmed by the
force and greatness of these men of the Renaissance,
and you will call out to your gondolier, ‘To the Lido,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
in order that you may find rest in Nature from the
dazzling things of art. In another week you will be
looking at Tintoret with a careless eye; for masterpieces
crowd too thick upon one another; bronzes,
enamels, triptychs, marbles, figures of doges lying on
their sculptured tombs, famous condottieri buried
in their armour, or standing haughty and valorous
in full panoply on their mausoleums, will leave you
indifferent. You are hungry for the open air, for the
lagoon, the changing aspects of the pearl-grey waves,
for Nature’s own reflections as Guardi and Canaletto
caught them.... As you get further from the shore,
you turn to enjoy the view, for it is the most splendid
scene ever dreamt by the imagination; and before
this picture of Venice—a picture signed by the Master
of masters—you forget the immortal works made by
hands that have been stiff for centuries.</p>

<h3 class="break">NIGHT IN VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Night</span> in Venice! Night is nowhere else so wonderful,
unless it be in winter among the high Alps. But the
nights of Venice and the nights of the mountains are
too different in kind to be compared.</p>

<p>There is the ever-recurring miracle of the full moon
rising, before day is dead, behind San Giorgio, spreading
a path of gold on the lagoon, which black boats
traverse with the glow-worm lamp upon their prow;
ascending the cloudless sky and silvering the domes
of the Salute; pouring vitreous sheen upon the red
lights of the Piazzetta; flooding the Grand Canal, and
lifting the Rialto higher in ethereal whiteness; piercing
but penetrating not the murky labyrinth of <i lang="it">rio</i>
linked with <i lang="it">rio</i>, through which we wind in light and
shadow, to reach once more the level glories and the
luminous expanse of heaven beyond Misericordia.</p>

<p>This is the melodrama of Venetian moonlight; and
if a single impression of the night has to be retained
from one visit to Venice, those are fortunate who
chance upon a full moon of fair weather. Yet I know
not whether some quieter and soberer effects are not
more thrilling. To-night, for example, the waning
moon will rise late through veils of <i lang="it">scirocco</i>. Over the
bridges of San Cristofore and San Gregorio, through
the deserted Calle di Mezzo, my friend and I walk in
darkness, pass the marble basements of the Salute,
and push our way along its Riva to the point of the
Dogana. We are out at sea alone, between the Canalozzo
and the Giudecca. A moist wind ruffles the
water and cools our forehead. It is so dark that we
can only see San Giorgio by the light reflected on it
from the Piazzetta. The same light climbs the Campanile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, and shows the golden angel in a
mystery of gloom. The only noise that reaches us is
a confused hum from the Piazza. Sitting and musing
there, the blackness of the water whispers in our ears
a tale of death. And now we hear a splash of oars,
and gliding through the darkness comes a single boat.
One man leaps upon the landing-place without a word
and disappears. There is another wrapped in a military
cloak asleep. I see his face beneath me, pale and
quiet. The <i lang="it">barcaruolo</i> turns the point in silence.
From the darkness they came; into the darkness they
have gone. It is only an ordinary incident of coastguard
service. But the spirit of the night has made
a poem of it.</p>

<p>Even tempestuous and rainy weather, though
melancholy enough, is never sordid here. There is no
noise from carriage traffic in Venice, and the sea-wind
preserves the purity and transparency of the atmosphere.
It had been raining all day, but at evening
came a partial clearing. I went down to the Molo,
where the large reach of the lagoon was all moon-silvered,
and San Giorgio Maggiore dark against the
bluish sky, and Santa Maria della Salute domed with
moon-irradiated pearl, and the wet slabs of the Riva
shimmering in moonlight, the whole misty sky, with
its clouds and stellar spaces, drenched in moonlight,
nothing but moonlight sensible except the tawny flare
of gas-lamps and the orange lights of gondolas afloat
upon the waters. On such a night the very spirit of
Venice is abroad. We feel why she is called Bride of
the Sea.</p>

<p>Take yet another night. There had been a representation
of Verdi’s <cite lang="it">Forza del Destino</cite> at the Teatro
Malibran. After midnight we walked homeward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
through the Merceria, crossed the Piazza, and dived
into the narrow <i lang="it">calle</i> which leads to the <i lang="it">traghetto</i> of
the Salute. It was a warm moist starless night, and
there seemed no air to breathe in those narrow alleys.
The gondolier was half asleep. Eustace called him as
we jumped into his boat, and rang our <i lang="it">soldi</i> on the
gunwale. Then he arose and turned the <i lang="it">ferro</i> round,
and stood across towards the Salute. Silently, insensibly,
from the oppression of confinement in the airless
streets to the liberty and immensity of the water and
the night we passed. It was but two minutes ere we
touched the shore and said good-night, and went our
way and left the ferryman. But in that brief passage
he had opened our souls to everlasting things—the
freshness, and the darkness, and the kindness of the
brooding, all-enfolding night above the sea.</p>

Then the days are hot, but not too hot, and the nights are
more beautiful than the days. Then Venice is rosier than
ever in the morning, and more golden than ever as the day
descends. It seems to expand and evaporate, to multiply
all its reflections and iridescences. Then the life of its people
and the strangeness of its constitution become a perpetual
comedy, or, at least, a perpetual drama. Then the gondola
is your sole habitation, and you spend days between sea and
sky.</p>

HOW SPRING COMES TO VENICE<br>
</h3>
</div><!--end chapter header-->

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Venice</span>, <i>1st May, 1834</i>.<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">My</span> friend, you have no idea of what Venice is. She
has not quitted the mourning garb she assumed in
winter, when you saw her ancient pillars of Greek
marble, which in colour and form you compared to
dry bones. At present, spring has breathed upon
her, as though her breath were emerald dust. The
base of her palaces, where oysters clustered in the
stagnant moss, is now covered with the most tender
green, and gondolas float between two banks of this
verdure, soft as velvet, and the noise of the water
dies away languishingly, mingled with the foam of the
gondola’s track. All the balconies are filled with
vases of flowers; and the flowers of Venice, brought
to light in this warm clayey soil, blossoming in this
damp atmosphere, have a freshness, a richness of
tissue, and a languor of attitude which makes them
resemble the women of this climate, whose beauty
is brilliant and evanescent as their own. The double
flowering bramble climbs round every pillar, and suspends
its garlands of white rosettes, from the black
arabesques of the balconies. The vanilla iris, the
Persian tulip, so beautifully striped with pure red
and white that it seems formed from the material in
which the ancient Venetians used to dress; Greek
roses, and pyramids of gigantic campanulas are
heaped in the vases which cover the balustrades.
Sometimes there is quite an arbour of honeysuckle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
crowning the balcony from one end to the other, and
two or three cages hidden in the foliage, contain
nightingales that sing day and night, as though they
were in the open country. These tame nightingales
are a luxury peculiar to Venice. The women there
have a remarkable talent for bringing up and educating,
so to speak, these poor harmonious prisoners, and
know how, by every species of delicacy and kindness,
to soften the <i lang="fr">ennui</i> of their captivity. In the night,
the birds call to and answer one another from each
side of the canal. If a serenade passes, they are
quiet and listen, and as soon as it has passed by, they
recommence their song, and seem vying to surpass the
melody they have just heard. At every street corner,
the Madonna shelters her mysterious lamp under a
jasmine canopy; and the <i lang="it">traghetti</i>, shaded by trellises,
diffuse, all along the Grand Canal, the perfume of the
vine in flower, perhaps the sweetest odour among
plants.</p>

<p>These <i lang="it">traghetti</i> are the stations for the public gondolas.
Those which are established on the shores
of the Canalazzo are the rendezvous of the porters
who come to smoke and talk with the gondoliers.
These often present very theatrical-looking groups.
Whilst one, lying on his gondola, alternately smiles
and yawns at the stars, another on the shore, with
open breast, and air of mockery, his hat thrust back
upon a forest of long crisp curled hair, throws his
great shadow on the wall. He is the hero of the
<i lang="it">traghetto</i>.</p>

SPRING IN VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> way in which the spring made itself felt upon
the lagoon was full of curious delight. It was not so
early in the season that we should know the spring by
the first raw warmth in the air, and there was as yet
no assurance of her presence in the growth—later so
luxuriant—of the coarse grasses of the shallows.
But somehow the spring was there, giving us new life
with every breath. There were fewer gulls than
usual, and those we saw sailed far overhead, debating
departure. There was deeper languor in the laziness
of the soldiers of finance, as they lounged and slept
upon their floating custom-houses in every channel
of the lagoons; and the hollow voices of the boatmen,
yelling to each other as their wont is, had an uncommon
tendency to diffuse themselves in echo. Over
all, the heavens had put on their summer blue, in
promise of that delicious weather which in the lagoons
lasts half the year, and which makes every other
climate seem niggard of sunshine and azure skies.
I know we have beautiful days at home—days of
which the sumptuous splendour used to take my
memory with unspeakable longing and regret even in
Italy;—but we do not have, week after week, month
after month, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p class="unindent">which, at Venice, contents all your senses, and
makes you exult to be alive with the inarticulate
gladness of children, or of the swallows that there
all day wheel and dart through the air, and shriek
out a delight too intense and precipitate for song.</p>

APRIL IN VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Venice</span>, <i>1st May, 1834</i>.<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Do</span> you remember that, when we left France, you said
you cared for nothing but sculptured marble? You
called me a savage, when I replied that I would quit
any palace in the world to see a mountain of unhewn
marble in the Alps or Apennines.</p>

<p>You may remember after a few days you were
satiated with statues, frescoes, churches, and galleries.
The sweetest <i lang="fr">souvenir</i> which was left to you was that
of the cold and limpid waters of a fountain where you
bathed your heated and weary brow in a garden in
Genoa. The creatures of art speak to the intellect
alone, but the spectacle of Nature appeals to every
faculty. It influences as through every pore, as well
as through every idea. To the entirely intellectual
pleasure of admiration the aspect of the country adds
a purely sensual enjoyment.</p>

<p>The freshness of the fountains, the perfume of
plants, the harmony of the winds, circulates through
every nerve, whilst the brilliancy of colours and
the beauty of outlines insinuate themselves into the
imagination. This feeling of pleasure and gratification
is appreciable by every organization, even the
commonest animals feel it to a certain degree. But
to an elevated mind it affords but a transitory
pleasure, an agreeable repose after the more energetic
functions of the intellect. To great minds, the entire
universe is necessary; the works of God, and the works
of man. The fountain of pure water invites and
charms you, but only for an instant do you repose
there. You must exhaust Michael Angelo and
Raphael before you linger again on the wayside;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
and when you have washed off the dust of the journey
in the waters of the spring, you pass on saying, ‘Let
us see what more there is under the sun.’</p>

<p>To minds so <i lang="fr">médiocre</i> and idle as my own, the side
of a hedge would suffice to sleep away my life, if this
rough and barren journey might be slept or dreamt
away. But even then, for me the fosse must be just
like this one of Bassano; that is to say, it must be
at least one hundred feet above a delicious valley,
and every morning must bring its breakfast on a
grassy slope covered with primroses, with excellent
coffee, mountain butter, and aniseed bread.</p>

<p>To such a breakfast I invite you, when you have
time to wish for repose. When that time comes,
everything will be known to you; life will have no
more secrets for you. Your hair will be slightly grey,
mine entirely so; but the valley of Bassano will be
just as lovely, the Alpine snows as pure; and our
friendship?—I trust in your heart, and I answer for
my own....</p>

<p>In the midst of this immense garden, the Brenta
flows rapidly and silently over its sandy bed, between
banks covered with pebbles and rocky fragments,
torn from the bosom of the Alps, with which it furrows
the plain in its days of anger. A half-circle of
fertile hills covered with those long vine branches
which suspend themselves from every tree in Venetia,
were the immediate border of the picture, and the
snowy mountains, sparkling in the sun’s first rays,
formed an immense framework which rose like a
silver fringe into the deep blue of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>‘I wish you to observe,’ said the doctor to me, ‘that
your coffee is getting cold, and the <i lang="it">vetturino</i> is waiting
for us.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
‘Now, Doctor,’ said I, ‘do you really believe I
am going back to Venice with you?’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Towards sunset I was in the public garden [of
Venice]. As usual, there was very little company
there. The elegant Venetian ladies dread the heat,
and dare not go out in full daylight, but they also
dread the cold, and never venture out in the night.
There are three or four days in each season which
seem expressly made for them, and then they raise
the covers of their gondolas, but they rarely put their
foot to the ground.</p>

<p>They are a <i lang="la">species</i> set apart, beings so frail and
delicate, that one ray of sunlight would wither their
beauty, or one breath of the breeze expose their very
existence. All civilized men seek those places by
preference where they may meet the fair sex; the
theatres, the <i lang="it">conversazioni</i>, the cafés, and the sheltered
enclosure of the Piazzetta, about seven o’clock in the
evening. Therefore few remain in the gardens, but
grumbling old men, stupid smokers, or melancholy
victims to bile. You may class me amongst whichever
you like of these three classes.</p>

<p>Gradually, I found myself quite alone; the elegant
café, which extends itself to the lagoons, extinguished
its tapers placed in lilies and marine flowers made of
the crystal of Murano.</p>

<p>The last time you saw this garden, it was damp
and sad enough! As for me, I went not there to
seek bright thoughts, nor hoping to disencumber
myself of my spleen. But the spring! as you say, who
can resist the influence of the month of April? and at
Venice, my dear friend, it is yet more impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
Even the stones are being clothed with verdure;
those infected marshes which our gondolas so carefully
avoided, two months since, are now watery
meadows covered by cresses, seaweeds, reeds and
flags, and all sorts of marine mosses, exhaling a
peculiar perfume, beloved by those to whom the sea
is a cherished memory; and harbouring thousands of
sea-gulls, divers, and the lesser bustard. The petrel
incessantly hovers over these floating meadows, where
the ebb and flow bring the waters of the Adriatic
every day, teeming with myriads of insects, madrepores,
and shells.</p>

<p>Instead of the icy-cold alleys from which we so
hastily fled, on the evening before your departure, and
which I had never since had the courage to revisit,
a half-warm sand, patches of Easter daisies, and
groves of sumach and sycamores were just opening to
the soft breezes from the Grecian shore. The little
promontory, planted in the English fashion, is so
beautiful, so thickly grown, so rich in flowers, perfume,
and prospect, that I asked myself if it were not
the promised land my dreams had revealed to me.
But no, the promised land is pure from all sorrow, and
this is already watered with my tears.</p>

<p>The sun had just sunk behind the Vicentine mountains.
Blue mists were covering the whole heaven
above Venice.</p>

<p>The tower of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, the cupolas of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary, and
little groves of pinnacles and minarets which rise
from all quarters of the town, were defined like so
many black points upon the vivid background of the
horizon. The colour of the heavens changed through
a wonderful gradation of softening tints, from crimson
to blue; and the water, calm and limpid, faithfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
reflected the rainbow tints of colour. Below the
town, the waves looked exactly like a large mirror of
red copper. Never had I seen Venice so beautiful, so
fairy-like. This black shadow thrown between the
sky and the glowing waters, as though in a lake of
fire, seemed one of those sublime aberrations of architecture
which the poet of the Apocalypse saw, in his
visions, floating on the shores of Patmos, when he
dreamed his new Jerusalem, and compared her to a
bride.</p>

<p>Little by little the bright colours faded, the outlines
became more massive, the depths more mysterious.
Venice assumed the aspect of an immense fleet, then
of a lofty wood of cypresses, into which the canals
flowed like high roads of silver sand. At such moments
I delight in contemplating the distance. When
the outlines become vague, when every object is
trembling in the mist, when my imagination may disport
in an immense field of conjecture and caprice,
when, by merely half closing the eyes, one can in
fancy destroy a city, turn it into a forest, a camp, or
a cemetery, when I can metamorphose the high
roads, white with dust, into peaceful rivers, and the
rivulets, winding so serpent-like down the dark
verdure of the hills, into rapid torrents, then it is that
I really enjoy Nature, I play with her, I reign over
her, with one glance I possess her and people her
with my own fantasies.</p>

<a id="p_330"></a>MAY IN VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p><i>May 17th, 4 p.m.</i>—Looking east the water is calm,
and reflects the sky and vessels, with this peculiarity:
the sky, which is pale blue, is in its reflection of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
same kind of blue, only a little deeper; but the
<em>vessels’ hulls, which are black, are reflected in pale
sea-green</em>—<i>i.e.</i>, the natural colour of the water under
sunlight—while the <em>orange masts</em> of the vessels, wet
with a recent shower, are reflected <em>without change of
colour</em>, only not quite so bright as above. One
ship has a white, another a red stripe (I ought to
have said running horizontally along the gunwales),
<em>of these the water takes no notice</em>.</p>

<p>What is curious, a boat passes across with white
and dark figures, the water reflects the dark ones
in green, and misses out all the white; this is chiefly
owing to the dark images being opposed to the bright
reflected sky.</p>

<p>A boat swinging near the quay casts an apparent
shadow on the rippled water. This appearance I find
to be owing altogether to the increased <em>reflective</em>
power of the water in the shaded space; for the
farther sides of the ripples therein take the deep pure
blue of the sky, coming strongly dark on the pale
green, and the nearer sides take the pale grey of the
cloud, hardly darker than the green.</p>

</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was still the hour that in one of his books he had
called ‘Titian’s hour,’ because in it all things seemed,
like that painter’s nude creations, to shine with a
rich glow of their own, and almost to illumine the
sky rather than receive light from it. The strange,
sumptuous octagonal temple drawn by Baldassare
Longhena from the dream of Polifilo was now emerging
from its blue-green shadow with its cupola, its
scrolls, its statues, its columns, its balustrades, like
a temple dedicated to Neptune, constructed after the
pattern of tortuous marine shapes, and shading off
into a haze of mother of pearl. In the hollows of the
stone the wet sea-salt had deposited something fresh
and silvery and jewel-like, that vaguely suggested
pearl shells lying open in their native waters....
Does it not strike you that we seem to be following the
princely retinue of dead Summer? There she lies,
sleeping in her funeral boat, all dressed in gold like
the wife of a Doge, like a Loredana, or a Morosina,
or a Soranza, of the enlightened centuries. And the
procession is taking her to the Island of Murano,
where some masterly Lord of Fire will make her a
crystal coffin. And the walls of the coffin shall be
of opal, so that when once submerged in the Laguna,
she may at least see the languid play of the seaweed
through her transparent eyelids, and while awaiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
the hour of resurrection give herself the illusion of
having still about her person the constant undulation
of her voluptuous hair....</p>

<p>Indeed, that sudden allegory in both its form and
rhythm truthfully expressed the feeling that was permeating
all things. As the milky blue of the opal
is filled with hidden fire, so the pale monotonous water
of the harbour held dissimulated splendours that were
brought to light by each shock of the oars. Beyond
the straight forest of ships motionless on their anchors
San Giorgio stood out like a vast rosy galley, its prow
turned to the <i>Fortuna</i> that attracted it from the
height of its golden sphere. A placid estuary opened
out in the centre of the Giudecca. The laden boats
that came down the rivers flowing into it brought
with their weight of splintered trunks what seemed the
very spirit of the woods that bend over the running
waters of their far-away sources.</p>

<p>And from the <i>Molo</i>, from the twofold miracle of
the porticoes open to the popular applause, where the
red and white wall rose as if to enclose that dominant
will, the Riva unfolded its gentle arch towards the
shady gardens and the fertile islands, as if to lead
away the thoughts excited by the arduous symbols
of art to the restfulness of Nature. And almost as
if still further to complete the avocation of Autumn
there passed a string of boats laden with fruit, like
great floating baskets that spread over the waters
reflecting the perpetual foliage of the cusps and
capitols, the fragrance of the island fruit gardens....</p>

<p>The bells of San Marco gave the signal for the
Angelus, and their ponderous roll dilated in long
waves along the mirror of the harbour, vibrated
through the masts of the ships, spread afar towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
the infinite lagoon. From San Giorgio Maggiore,
from San Giorgio dei Greci, from San Giorgio degli
Schiavoni, from San Giovanni in Bragora, from San
Moise, from the churches of the Salute and the Redentore
and beyond, over the whole domain of the
Evangelist, from the far towers of the Madonna dell’
Orto, of San Giobbe, of Sant’ Andrea, bronze voices
answered, mingling in one great chorus, spreading
over the silent company of stones and water one
great dome of invisible metal, the vibrations of which
seemed to reach the twinkling of the earliest stars.
In the purity of evening the sacred voices gave the
City of Silence a sort of immensity of grandeur.
From the summit of their temples they brought
anxious mankind the message sent by the immortal
multitudes hidden in the darkness of deep aisles, or
mysteriously troubled by the light of votive lamps;
they brought to spirits worn out by the day the message
of the superhuman creatures figured on the
walls of secluded chapels and in the niches of inner
altars, who had announced miracles and promised
worlds. And all the apparitions of the consoling
Beauty invoked by unanimous Prayer, rose on that
storm of sound, spoke in that aerial chorus, irradiated
the face of the marvellous night.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One afternoon not long ago, returning from the
Gardens along the warm bank of the Schiavoni, that
must often have seemed to some wandering poet like
I know not what golden magic bridge stretching out
over a sea of light and silence to some infinite dream
of beauty, I thought, or rather I stood by and watched
my own thoughts as I would an intimate spectacle,—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
thought of the nuptial alliance of Autumn and
Venice under those skies.</p>

<p>A sense of life was diffused everywhere; a sense of
life made up of passionate expectation and restrained
ardour, that surprised me by its vehemence, but yet
could not seem new to me, because I had already
found it gathered in some belt of shadow under the
almost deathly immobility of summer, and I had also
felt it here vibrating now and then like a mysterious
pulsation under the strange, feverish odour of the
waters. Thus, I thought, this pure City of Art truly
aspires to the supreme condition of that beauty that
is an annual return in her as is the giving forth of
flowers to the forest. She tends to reveal herself
in a full harmony as if she still carried in herself,
powerful and conscious, that desire of perfection from
which she was born and formed through the ages like
some divine creature. Under the motionless fires of
a summer sky she seemed pulseless and breathless,
dead indeed in her green waters; but my feeling did
not deceive me when I divined her secretly labouring
under a spirit of life that would prove sufficiently
powerful to renew the highest of older miracles....</p>

<p>The mutual passion of Venice and Autumn that
exalts the one and the other to the highest degree of
their sensuous beauty has its origin in a deep affinity;
for the soul of Venice, the soul fashioned for the City
Beautiful by its great artists is autumnal.</p>

<p>The correspondence between the external and the
interior spectacle once discovered, my enjoyment
found itself unspeakably multiplied. The crowd of
imperishable forms that peoples its churches and
palaces seemed from these latter to answer the harmony
of daylight with a chord so deep and powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
that it soon became dominant. And—because the
light of Heaven alternates with shadows, but the light
of Art lasts in the human soul and cannot be extinguished—when
the miracle of the hour ceased to
cover all those things, my spirit felt itself alone and
ecstatic among the splendours of an ideal autumn.</p>

ALL SOULS’ DAY AT VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">They</span> had put a bridge of boats from the northernmost
quay of Venice to the cemetery island. A dense
crowd, coming and going across it, black over the
black anchored barges, each two with their yard of
pale water between their tarred hulls. And, as we
draw near, as we go beneath, the seeming silence
turns into a murmur, and a rumble.</p>

<p>For this one day in all the year the cemetery
island is bridged on to the islands of the living. This
is no mere coincidence, but a real symbol.</p>

<p>The cloisters and the gardens are full as for a fair,
crowds coming and going, buying tapers, lighting
them at the glittering wax-lights before the chapel,
bringing a few flowers.... Surely for these poor
folk there is a reality, if only a negative one, in this
suspending of the labour, cares, the empty grind of
life; and their hour of watching by the dead may be,
in some way deeper than words can say, an hour of
communing with the eternities.</p>

<p>While thus the cemetery was given up to the living
and to the long dead, the scarcely dead, the real
dead, were arriving here and there with the real
mourners. I noted a mound of fresh earth, with the
ritual trowel sticking in it, a couple of surpliced and
shaven Franciscans reciting the prayers to a few
blear, red-eyed people (a nun among them); all these
new-comers and their ministering clergy seeming a
little scared by intruding their own dead man or
woman into this great public feast of those who have
long passed beyond. And the crowd, on its side,
looked surprised at this new and definite reality of
loss in the midst of its vaguer mournings; this man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
or woman, only just dead, carried in among those
shadowy memories.</p>

<p>Very touching also were the little framed photographs,
clean and evidently taken off some poor table
or wall, and hung on the cross for the afternoon; the
dead pauper having his effigy also on his grave, like
the rich man among his marble, if only for those few
hours.</p>

<p>As we got back into the gondola the crowd was
streaming only one way along the black bridge;
away from the cemetery, back into life.</p>

THE ORIGIN OF VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Venice</span>, being a republic, which, both on account of
its power and internal regulations, deserves to be
celebrated above any principality of Italy.... I
speak of their (the Venetians’) city from a remote
period.... When Attila, king of the Huns, besieged
Aquileia, the inhabitants, after defending themselves
a long time, began to despair of effecting their safety,
and fled for refuge to several uninhabited rocks,
situate at the point of the Adriatic Sea, now called
the Gulf of Venice, carrying with them whatever
moveable property they possessed. The people of
Padua, finding themselves in equal danger, and knowing
that, having become master of Aquileia, Attila
would next attack themselves, also removed with
their most valuable property to a place on the same
sea, called Rivo Alto, to which they brought their
women, children, and aged persons, leaving the youth
in Padua to assist in her defence. Besides these, the
people of Monselice, with the inhabitants of the surrounding
hills, driven by similar fears, fled to the
same rocks. But after Attila had taken Aquileia, and
destroyed Padua, Monselice, Vicenza, and Verona,
the people of Padua and others who were powerful
continued to inhabit the marshes about Rivo Alto;
and in like manner all the people of the province
anciently called Venetia, drived by the same events,
became collected in these marshes. Thus, under the
pressure of necessity, they left an agreeable and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
fertile country to occupy one sterile and unwholesome.
However, in consequence of a great number of
people being drawn together into a comparatively
small space, in a short time they made those places
not only habitable, but delightful; and having
established among themselves laws and useful regulations,
enjoyed themselves in security amid the
devastations of Italy, and soon increased both in
reputation and strength. For, besides the inhabitants
already mentioned, many fled to these places from the
cities of Lombardy, principally to escape from the
cruelties of Clefis, king of the Lombards, which
greatly tended to increase the numbers of the new
city; and in the conventions which were made betwixt
Pepin, king of France, and the emperor of Greece
when the former, at the entreaty of the pope, came to
drive the Lombards out of Italy, the duke of Benevenuto
and the Venetians did not render obedience to
either the one or the other, but alone enjoyed their
liberty. As necessity had led them to dwell on sterile
rocks, they were compelled to seek the means of subsistence
elsewhere; and voyaging with their ships to
every port of the ocean, their city became a depository
for the various products of the world, and was itself
filled with men of every nation.</p>

<p>For many years the Venetians sought no other
dominion than that which tended to facilitate their
commercial enterprises, and thus acquired many ports
in Greece and Syria; and as the French had made
frequent use of their ships in voyages to Asia, the
island of Candia was assigned to them, in recompense
for these services. Whilst they lived in this manner,
their name spread terror over the seas, and was held
in veneration throughout Italy. This was so completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
the case, that they were generally chosen to
arbitrate in controversies arising betwixt the states,
as occurred in the difference betwixt the Colleagues, on
account of the cities they had divided amongst themselves;
which being referred to the Venetians, they
awarded Brescia and Bergamo to the Visconti. But
when, in the course of time, urged by their eagerness
for dominion, they had made themselves masters of
Padua, Vicenza, Trevisa, and afterwards of Verona,
Bergamo, and Brescia, with many cities in Romanga,
and the kingdom of Naples, other nations were impressed
with such an opinion of their power, that they
were a terror, not only to the princes of Italy, but to
the Ultramontane kings. These states entered into
an alliance against them, and in one day wrested from
them the provinces they had obtained with so much
labour and expense; and although they have in latter
times re-acquired some portions, still, possessing
neither power nor reputation, like all the other Italian
powers, they live at the mercy of others....</p>

<p>Amongst the great and wonderful institutions of the
republics and principalities of antiquity that have
now gone into disuse, was that by means of which
towns and cities were from time to time established;
and there is nothing more worthy the attention of a
great prince, or of a well-regulated republic, or that
confers so many advantages upon a province, as the
settlement of new places, where men are drawn together
for mutual accommodation and defence.
This may easily be done, by sending people to reside
in recently acquired or uninhabited countries. Besides
causing the establishment of new cities, these
removals render a conquered country more secure,
and keep the inhabitants of a province properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
distributed. Thus deriving the greatest attainable
comfort, the inhabitants increase rapidly, are more
prompt to attack others, and defend themselves with
greater assurance. This custom, by the unwise practice
of princes and republics, having gone into desuetude,
the ruin and weakness of territories has followed;
for this ordination is that by which alone
empires are made secure, and countries become
populated. Safety is the result of it; because the
colony which a prince establishes in a newly acquired
country is like a fortress and a guard, to keep the inhabitants
in fidelity and obedience. Neither can a
province be wholly occupied and preserve a proper distribution
of its inhabitants without this regulation;
for all districts are not equally healthy, and hence
some will abound to overflowing, whilst others are
void.... With cultivation the earth becomes fruitful,
and the air is purified with fires—remedies which
Nature cannot provide. The city of Venice proves the
correctness of these remarks. Being placed in a marshy
and unwholesome situation, it became healthy only
by the number of industrious individuals who were
drawn together.</p>

<a id="p_348"></a>A PILGRIM’S DESCRIPTION OF VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> Wednesday, the 21st of May [1494], I took one of
the Milanese couriers to guide me about Venice, and
went to the houses of the merchants for whom I had
letters, and to each one I gave his own. Then, as I
was afraid of not finding a place in the galley, I was
immediately introduced to the Magnificent Don
Agostino Contarini, a Venetian patrician and captain
of the Jaffa galley—thus the galley is named which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
carries the pilgrims going to Jerusalem—and he
ordered my name to be written in the Pilgrims’
Book. At this time I found that I had been in too
great a hurry to leave home, and that I must wait
several days before the departure of the said galley.</p>

<p>In order that the tediousness of waiting should not
make me desire to turn back and do as the children
of Israel did when they went into the Promised Land,
I determined to examine carefully the city of Venice,
about which so much has been said and written, not
only by learned men, but also by great scholars, that
it appears to me there is nothing left to say. And I
did this solely to amuse myself during the time I had
to spend in such a great port. I wanted to see everything
it was possible for me to see; and I was aided continually
by the company given me by the Magnificent
Doctor and Cavalier, the Lord Tadiolo de Vicomercato,
Ambassador to the aforesaid Signoria of Venice for
our most illustrious Lord the Duke of Milan. I paid
him a visit, as was my duty, as soon as I arrived, and
from him, although I did not merit it, I received more
than common attention.</p>

<p>Before going further, I must make excuses to the
readers of this my itinerary, if it should seem to them
that I have overpraised this city of Venice. What I
write is not written to win the goodwill of the Venetians,
but to set down the truth. And I declare that
it is impossible to tell or write fully of the beauty, the
magnificence or the wealth of the city of Venice.
Something indeed can be told and written to pass the
time as I do, but it will be incredible to anyone who
has not seen the city.</p>

<p>I do not think there is any city to which Venice, the
city founded on the sea, can be compared; nevertheless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
I appeal always to the judgment of every person
who has been there some time. Although this city is
built entirely in the water and the marshes, yet it
appears to me that whoever desires to do so can go
everywhere on foot, as it is well kept and clean. Anyone,
however, who does not want to endure the
fatigue can go by water, and will be entreated to do
so, and it will cost him less than he would spend elsewhere
for the hire of a horse. As to the size of the city,
I may say that it is so large, that, after being there so
many days as I was, I made but little acquaintance
with the streets. I cannot give the dimensions of this
city, for it appears to me not one city alone but
several cities placed together.</p>

<p>I saw many beautiful palaces, beginning with the
Palace of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, which is always inhabited by the
Doge and his family. The façade of the said palace has
been renovated in part with a great display of gold;
and a new flight of steps is being built there—a
stupendous and costly work—by which to ascend to
the said palace from the side of the Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Mark.... Besides the other notable things in the
said palace, I saw a very long hall whose walls are
painted very ornately. And there is painted the story
how Frederick Barbarossa drove away Pope Alexander
the Fourth, who fled in disguise to Venice, and
was recognized in a monastery called the Monastery
della Carità. The whole story is represented with
such richness and naturalness in the figures that I
think little could be added. The ceiling of the said
hall is decorated with great gilded pictures. Seats are
placed round the said hall, and in addition there are
three rows of double seats, in the body of the hall,
placed back to back. There are two magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
gilded seats, one at each end of the said hall; I was
told they were for seating the Doge, one for the
winter and the other for the summer. In this hall sit
the Great Council of all the gentlemen, who, it is said,
are two thousand five hundred in number....</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe the number of large
and beautiful palaces splendidly decorated and furnished,
worth, some a hundred, some fifty, some
thirty thousand ducats, and the owners of the same,
because it would be too hard an undertaking for me,
and better suited to someone who had to remain a
long time in the said city of Venice. On the Grand
Canal there is the most remarkable beginning of a
palace for the Sforza family, and for the honour of the
Milanese I am very sorry it has not been finished.
For after seeing the said foundations, I am sure that
the palace would be very magnificent if it were completed.</p>

<p>The said city, although it is in the water, as I said,
has so many beautiful piazzas, beginning with that of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, that they would suffice for any great city
placed on the mainland. It is a marvel to see how long
and spacious they are. I have observed that the said
city is so well ordered and arranged, that however
much it rains, there is never any mud.</p>

<p>Something may be said about the quantity of
merchandise in the said city, although not nearly
the whole truth, because it is inestimable. Indeed, it
seems as if all the world flocks there, and that human
beings have concentrated there all their force for
trading....</p>

<p>As the day of our departure was drawing near, I
determined to leave everything else and study the
owners of the many beautiful things I have noted—that is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
the Venetian gentlemen, who give themselves
this title. I have considered the qualities of these
Venetian gentlemen. For the most part they are tall,
handsome men, astute and very subtle in their
dealings, and whoever has to do business with them
must keep his eyes and ears well open. They are
proud—I think this is on account of their great
dominions—and when a son is born to a Venetian
gentleman they say to themselves, ‘A Lord is born
into the world’ (<i lang="it">E le nato un Signore al Mondo</i>).
They are frugal and very modest in their manner of
living at home; outside the house they are very
liberal.</p>

<p>The city of Venice preserves its ancient fashion of
dress—which never changes—that is, a long garment
of any colour that is preferred. No one would leave
the house by day if he were not dressed in this long
garment, and for the most part in black. They have
so observed this custom, that the individuals of every
nation in the world—which has a settlement in Venice—all
adopt this style, from the greatest to the least,
beginning with the gentlemen, down to the sailors
and <i lang="it">galeotti</i>. Certainly it is a dress which inspires confidence,
and is very dignified. The wearers all seem
to be doctors in law, and if a man should appear out
of the house without his toga, he would be thought
mad....</p>

<p>When the Venetian gentlemen take office or go on
some embassy, they wear very splendid garments;
in truth, they could not be more magnificent. They
are of scarlet, of velvet, of brocade, if the wearers hold
high office; and all the linings of every kind are very
costly.... The Venetian women, especially the pretty
ones, try as much as possible in public to show their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
chests—I mean their breasts and shoulders—so much
so, that several times when I saw them I marvelled
that their clothes did not fall off their backs. Those
who can afford it, and also those who cannot, dress
very splendidly, and have magnificent jewels and
pearls in the trimming round their collars. They
wear many rings on their fingers, with great balass
rubies, rubies and diamonds. I said also those who
cannot afford it, because I was told that many of
them hire these things. They paint their faces a great
deal, and also the other parts they show, in order to
appear more beautiful.... I thought it my duty to
seek out the churches and monasteries and go and see
the relics which are very numerous; and this seemed

<a id="p_353"></a>VENICE: SOME SIXTEENTH-CENTURY
CHARACTERISTICS<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I came</span> to Venice at the time of a Faire, which lasted
fourteene dayes, wherein I sawe very many, and faire
shewes of wares. I came thither too short for the first
passage, which went from Venice about the seventh
or eighth of May, and with them about three score
pilgrims, which shippe was cast away at a towne
called Estria, two miles from Venice, and all the men
in hers, saving thirtie, or thereabouts, lost.</p>

<p>Within eight dayes after fell Corpus Christi day,
which was a day amongst them of procession, in
which was shewed the plate and treasurie of Venice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
which is esteemed to be worth two millions of pounds,
but I do not accompt it woorth halfe a quarter of
that money, except there be more than I sawe. To
speake of the sumptuousnesse of the copes and vestments
of the Church, I leave, but the trueth is, they
bee very sumptuous, many of them set all over with
pearle, and made of cloth of gold....</p>

<p>To tell you of the duke of Venice, and of the
Seigniory: there is one chosen that ever beareth the
name of duke, but in trueth hee is but servant to the
Seigniorie, for of himselfe hee can doe little: it is no
otherwise with him, then with a priest that is at
Masse upon a festival day, which putting on his
golden garment, seemeth to be a great man, but if
any man came unto him, and crave some friendship
at his handes, hee will say, you must goe to the
Masters of the parish, for I can not pleasure you,
otherwise then by preferring of your suite: and so
it is with the duke of Venice, if any man having a
suite, came to him, and make his complaint, and
deliver his supplication, it is not in him to help him,
but hee will tell him, You must come this day, or
that day, and then I will preferre your suite to the
Seigniorie, and doe you the best friendship that I
may. Furthermore, if any man bring a letter unto
him, he may not open it, but in the presence of the
Seigniorie, and they are to see it first, which being
read, perhaps they will deliver it to him, perhaps
not. Of the Seigniory there be about three hundred,
and about fourtie of the privie Counsell of Venice,
who usually are arayed in gownes of crimsen Satten,
or crimsen Damaske, when they sit in Counsell.</p>

<p>In the Citie of Venice, no man may weare a weapon,
except he be a soldier for the Seigniorie, or a skoller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
of Padua, or a gentleman of great countenance, and
yet he may not do that without licence.</p>

<p>As for the women of Venice, they be rather
monsters, then women. Every Shoemakers or Taylors
wife will have a gowne of silke, and one to carrie up
her traine, wearing their shooes very neere halfe a
yard high from the ground: if a stranger meete one
of them, he will surely think by the state that she
goeth with, that he meeteth a Lady.</p>

<a id="p_355"></a>THE BEAUTIE AND MAGNIFICENCE OF VENICE
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I having</span> oftentimes observed many strangers, men
wise and learned, who arriving newly at <em>Venice</em>, and
beholding the beautie and magnificence thereof, were
stricken with so great an admiration and amazement,
that they woulde, and that with open mouth, confesse,
never any thing which before time they had seene,
to be thereunto comparable, either in glory or goodlinesse.
Yet was not every one of them possessed with
the like wonder of the same particular thing: for to
some it seemed a matter of infinite marvaile, and
scarcely credible to behold, so unmeasurable a quantity
of all sorts of merchandise to be brought out of
all realmes and countries into this Citie, and hence
againe to be conveyed into so many strange and far
distant nations, both by land and sea. Others exceedingly
admired the wonderful concourse of strange
and forraine people, yea, of the farthest and the remotest
nations, as though the City of <em>Venice</em> onely
were a common and general market to the whole
world. Others were astonished at the greatnesse of
the empire thereunto belonging, and the mightinesse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
of their state both by land and sea: but the greater
part of the most wise and judiciall sort were rather
in themselves confounded with amazement at the
new and strange manner of the situation of this Citie,
so fitte and convenient for all things, that it seemed
unto them a thing rather framed by the hands of the
immortall gods, than any way by the arte, industry,
or invention of men. And for this only cause deemed
the Citie of <em>Venice</em> to excell all those, that in this age
are to be found, or at any time ever were.... The
situation of <em>Venice</em> being rather to be attributed to
some divine providence, than to any human industry,
is (beyond the beliefe of all those that have not seene
this cittie) not onely most safe and secure, both by
land and sea from all violence, but also in the highest
degree opportune and commodious to the aboundance
of all thinges that are behoovefull to the citizens, as
also for traffique of all sortes of merchandise, in
manner with all nations of the worlde. For it is seated
in a remote and secrete place of the Adriatike sea,
where on that side (where the sea beholdeth the continent)
there are mightie great lakes; fortified with
an admirable artifice of nature. For twelve miles off
the continent, the sea beginneth to be shallow: the
banke which ariseth behind these shallowes, reacheth
almost three score miles, and incloseth the lakes
within.... In this manner therefore are the lakes of
the Citie of <em>Venice</em> inclosed, partly with firme ground,
partly with this banke and shallowes: in middle of the
which, in that place, which of our ancestors was
called <em>Rialta</em>, and as yet retaineth the name, was the
Citie of <em>Venice</em> budded, at such time as the <i>Hunnes</i>
under the conduct of <i>Atyla</i> did spoile with fire and
sword the territory of Venetia, a noble province of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
<i>Italie</i>, which bordered upon those lakes: in which
calamitous time the citizens of <i>Padua</i>, of <i>Aquilea</i>, of
<i>Concordia</i>, and of <i>Altina</i>, being all faire and goodly
cities of <i>Venetia</i>, such of them as were chiefe in riches,
and nobility, did first get themselves with their
families into certaine islands, or rather little hills,
which did appear out somewhat above the sea, and
there built them places of abode, in which as in a
secure haven they avoyded the ragefull tempest of
the <i>Hunnes</i>.</p>

<a id="p_357b"></a>SOME MARVELS OF VENICE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> stately City built on the bottome of the gulfe of
the Adriatique Sea, in the midst of marshes upon
many ilands, is defended on the East side against the
sea, by a banke of earthe, which hath five (or some
say seven) mouths or passages into the sea, and is
vulgarly called <dfn>Il Lido</dfn>: and being so placed by
nature, not made by art, bendeth like a bowe, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
reacheth thirty-five miles.... Venice hath thirty one
Cloysters of Monkes, and twenty eight of nunnes,
besides chappels and almes-houses. Channels of water
passe through this city (consisting of many ilands
joyned with bridges) as the bloud passeth through
the veines of a man’s body; so that a man may passe
to what place he will both by land and water. The
great channell is in length about one thousand three
hundred paces, and in breadth forty paces, and hath
only one bridge called <dfn>Rialto</dfn>, and the passage is very
pleasant by this channel; being adorned on both sides
with stately pallaces. And that men may pass
speedily, besides this bridge, there be thirteen places
called <dfn>Traghetti</dfn>, where boats attend called <dfn>gondole</dfn>,
which being of incredible number give ready passage
to all men. The rest of the channels running through
lesse streets, are more narrow, and in them many
bridges are to be passed under. The aforesaid boats
are very neat, and covered all save the ends with
black cloth, so as the passengers may goe unseene
and unknowne, and not bee annoyed at all with the
sunne, winde, or raine. And these boats are ready at
call any minute of the day or night. And if a stranger
know not the way, hee shall not need to aske it, for
if he will follow the presse of people, hee shall be sure
to bee brought to the market place of Saint <i>Mark</i>, or
that of <i>Rialto</i>; the streets being very narrow (which
they pave with bricke), and besides if hee onely know
his host’s name, taking a boat, he shall be safely
brought thither at any time of the night.... Saint
<i>Marke</i> is the protecting saint of this city. The body
of which saint being brought hither by merchants
from <i>Alexandria</i>: this church was built in the year
829 at the charge of the Duke <i>Justinian</i>, who dying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
gave by his last will great treasure to that use, and
charged his brother to finish the building, which was
laid upon the ruines of Saint <i>Theodore’s</i> Church, who
formerly had been the protecting saint of the city....
The building is become admirable, for the singular art
of the builders and painters, and the most rare peeces
of marble, porphyry, ophites (stones so called of
speckles like a serpent) and like stones; and they
cease not still to build it, as if it were unfinished, lest
the revenues given by the last wils of dead men to
that use, should return to their heirs (as the common
report goes).... Upon the ground neere the great
door, is a stone, painted as if it were engraven, which
painting is vulgarly called, <i>a la mosaica</i>, and upon
this stone <i>Pope Alexander</i> set his foot upon the necke
of the Emperor <i>Frederick Barbaross</i>, adoring him
after his submission. The outward part of the church
is adorned with one hundred and forty eight pillars
of marble, whereof some are ophytes, that is speckled,
and eight of them are porphyry neere the great doore,
which are highly esteemed. And in all places about
the church, there be some six hundred pillars of
marble, besides some three hundred in the caves
under ground. Above these pillars on the outside
of the church is an open gallery, borne up with like
pillars, from whence the Venetians at times of feasts,
behold any shewes in the market place. And above
this gallery, and over the great door of the church, be
foure horses of brass, gilded over, very notable for
antiquity and beauty; and they are so set, as if at
the first step they would leap into the market place.
They are said to be made to the similitude of the
horses of <i>Phœbus</i>, drawing the Chariot of the Sunne,
and to have been put upon the triumphal arch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
<i>Nero</i>, by the people of Rome, when he had overcome
the Parthians.... Above this gallery the image of
Saint <i>Marke</i>, of marble, and like images of the other
Evangelists and of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, and of the
<i>Angel Gabriell</i>, are placed, and there is a bell upon
which the houres are sounded, for the church hath his
clock, though another very faire clocke in the market
place be very neere.... I passe over the image of
Saint <i>Marke</i> of brass in the forme of a lion, guilded
over, and holding a booke of brasse. Likewise the
artificiall images of the Doctors of the Church, and
others. I would passe over the image of the Virgin
<i>Mary</i>, painted <i>a la mosaica</i>, that is as if it were engraven,
but that they attribute great miracles to it,
so as women desirous to know the state of their
absent friends, place a wax candle burning in the
open air before the image, and beleeve that if their
friend be alive, it cannot be put out with any force
of wind; but if he be dead, that the least breath of
wind puts it out, or rather of it self it goes out: and
besides for that I would mention that those who are
adjudged to death, offer waxe candles to this image,
and as they passe by, fall prostrate to adore the same.
To conclude, I would not omit mention thereof,
because all shippes comming into haven, use to salute
this image, and that of Saint <i>Marke</i>, with pieces of
ordinance, as well and more than the Duke. A merchant
of <i>Venice</i> saved from shipwracke, by the light
of a candle in a darke night, gave by his last will to
this image, that his heires for ever should find a waxe
candle to burne before the same.... Touching the
inside of the church: In the very porch thereof is
the image of Saint <i>Marke</i>, painted with wonderfull
art, and the Images of Christ crucified, of Him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
buried, and of the foure Evangelists, highly esteemed;
besides many other much commended for the said
painting like engraving, and for other workemanship.
And there be erected foure great pillars of ophites,
which they say were brought from the Temple of
<i>Salomon</i>. At the entery of the doore, is an old and
great sepulcher, in which lies the Duke <i>Marino
Morosini</i>. Not far thence is the image of Saint
<i>Geminian</i> in pontificall habit, and another of Saint
<i>Katherine</i>, both painted with great art. When you
enter the body of the church there is the great altar,
under which lies Saint <i>Marke</i>, in a chest of brasse,
decked with images of silver guilded, and with plates
of gold, and images enamelled, and with the image
of Christ sitting upon a stately throne, adorned with
pillars of most white marble, and many precious
stones, and curiously engraven. At the back of this
altar there is another, which they call the altar of
the most Holy Sacrament, made of best marble, with
a little doore of brasse, decked with carved images,
and with foure pillars of alabaster, transparent as
christall, and highly esteemed; and upon the same
hang every day two lampes of copper: and at the
times of feasts there hang two of pure silver.... At
the entry of the chancell, is the throne of the dukes,
make of walnut-tree, all carved above the head, and
when the dukes sit there, it was wont to be covered
with carnation satten, but now it is covered with
cloth of gold, given by the King of Persia. There be
two stately pulpits of marble, with histories carved in
brass, where they sing the Epistles and Gospels. On
the left hand by the altar of Saint <i>James</i> is a place,
where (if a man may beleeve it) the body of Saint
<i>Marke</i>, by a crevice suddenly breaking through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
marble stone, appeared in the yeere 1094, to certaine
priests who had fasted and praied to find the same,
the memory of the place where it was laied at the
building of the church about 829 being utterly
lost....</p>

<p>The foure square market place of <i>Rialto</i> is compassed
with publike houses, under the arches whereof,
and in the middle part lying open, the merchants
meet. And there is also a peculiar place where the
gentlemen meet before noone, as they meet in the
place of Sainte <i>Marke</i> towards evening; and here to
nourish acquaintance, they spend an houre in discourses,
and because they use not to make feasts one
to another, they keepe this meeting as strictly as
merchants, lest their friendship should decay. The
gold-smiths shoppes lie thereby, and over against
them shoppes of jewellers, in which art the Venetians
are excellent.... To conclude: this most noble city,
as well for the situation, freeing them from enemies,
as for the freedome of the Common-wealth, preserved
from the first founding, and for the freedome which
the citizens and very strangers have, to enjoy their
goods, and dispose of them, and for manifold other
causes, is worthily called in Latine <i>Venetia</i>, as it
were <i>Veni etiam</i>, that is, <i>come again</i>.</p>

<a id="p_363b"></a>THE MARRIAGE OF VENICE WITH THE SEA<br>
</h3>
<p class="center allsmcap small">HOW THE CEREMONY WAS FIRST INSTITUTED<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">From</span> Venice wee departed on the twentieth of August
1610, in the <i>Little Defence</i> of London. The Venetians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
are Lords of this Sea, but not without contention
with the Papacie. On Ascention Day, the Duke accompanyed
with the Clarissimoes of that Signiory, is
rowed thither in the Bucentoro, a triumphall Galley,
richly, and exquisitely gilded: above a roome (beneath
which they row) comprehending the whole
length and breadth of the Galley; neere the poope a
throne, and the rest accommodated with seates, where
he solemnely espouseth the Sea: confirmed by a Ring
throwne therein, the Nuptiall Pledge and Symboll of
subjection. The Ceremonie received a beginning from
the Sea-battell fought and wonne by the Venetians,
under the conduct of Sebastiano Zani, against the
forces of Fredericke Barbarossa, in the quarrell of
Pope Alexander the Third. Who flying his furie in
the habit of a Cooke repayred to Venice, and there
long lived disguised in the Monastery of Charitie.
Zani returning in triumph with the Emperours
Sonne, was met by the Pope, and saluted in this
manner: Here take, O Zani, this Ring of Gold, and
by giving it to the Sea, oblige it unto thee. A ceremonie
shall on this day bee yearly observed, both
by thee and thy Successors, that Posteritie may know
how you have purchast the Dominion thereof by your
valours, and made it subject unto you, as a Wife to
her Husband.</p>

<a id="p_364"></a>THE DOGE OF VENICE GOES IN STATE<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I was</span> present at high mass this morning, October 6th,
which annually on this day the Doge must attend, in
the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Justina, to commemorate an old
victory over the Turks. When the gilded barks,
which carry the princes and a portion of the nobility,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
approach the little square, when the boatmen, in
their rare liveries, are plying their red-painted oars,
when on the shore the clergy and the religious fraternities
are standing, pushing, moving about, and
waiting with their lighted torches fixed upon poles
and portable silver chandeliers; then, when the
gangways, covered with carpets, are placed from the
vessels to the shore, and first the full violet dresses
of the Savii, next the ample red robes of the Senators
are unfolded upon the pavement, and lastly when
the old Doge—adorned with his golden Phrygian
cap, in his long golden <i>talar</i> and his ermine cloak,
steps out of the vessel—when all this, I say, takes
place in a little square before the portal of a church,
one feels as if one were looking at an old worked
tapestry, exceedingly well designed and coloured. To
me, northern fugitive as I am, this ceremony gave a
great deal of pleasure. With us, who parade nothing
but short coats in our processions of pomp, and who
conceive nothing greater than one performed with
shouldered arms, such an affair might be out of place.
But these trains, these peaceful celebrations, are all
in keeping here.</p>

<p>The Doge is a well-grown and well-shaped man,
who, perhaps, suffers from ill health, but, nevertheless,
for dignity’s sake, bears himself upright under
his heavy robe. In other respects he looks like the
grandpapa of the whole race, and is kind and affable.
His dress is very becoming, the little cap, which he
wears under the large one, does not offend the eye,
resting as it does upon the whitest and finest hair in
the world.</p>

<p>About fifty <i>nobili</i>, with long, dark-red trains,
were with him. For the most part they were handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
men, and there was not a single uncouth figure
among them. Several of them were tall with large
heads, so that the white curly wigs were very becoming
to them. Their features are prominent; the
flesh of their faces is soft and white, without looking
flabby and disagreeable. On the contrary, there is
an appearance of talent without exertion, repose, self-confidence,
easiness of existence, and a certain
joyousness pervades the whole.</p>

<p>When all had taken their places in the church, and
mass began, the fraternities entered by the chief
door, and went out at the side door to the right, after
they had received holy water in couples, and made
their obeisance to the high altar, to the Doge, and the
nobility.</p>

VENETIAN DAMES<br>
</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was now Ascension Weeke, and the greate Marte
or Faire of the whole yeare was now kept, every body
at liberty and jollie. The noblemen stalking with
their ladys on <i>choppines</i>; these are high-heel’d shoes,
particularly affected by these proude dames, or, as
some may say, invented to keepe them at home, it
being very difficult to walke with them; whence one
being asked how he liked the Venetian dames, replied
that they were <i lang="it">mezzo carne, mezzo ligno</i>, half
flesh, half wood, and he would have none of them.
The truth is, their garb is very odd, as seeming allwayes
in masquerade; their other habits are also
totally different from all nations. They weare long
crisped haire, of severall strakes and colours, which
they make so by a wash, dishevelling it on the brims
of a broade hat that has no head, but an hole to put
out their heads by; they drie them in the sunne, as
one may see them at their windows. In their tire they
set silk flowers and sparkling stones, their peticoates
coming from their very arme-pits, so that they are
neere three-quarters and an half apron; their sleeves
are made exceedingly wide ... and commonly tucked
up to the shoulder, showing their naked armes, thro’
false sleeves of tiffany, girt with a bracelet or two,
with knots of points richly tagged about their shoulders
and other places of their body, which they usually
cover with a kind of yellow vaile of lawn very transparent.
Thus attir’d they set their hands on the
heads of two matron-like servants or old women, to
support them, who are mumbling their beades. ’Tis
ridiculous to see how these ladys crawle in and out of
their <i>gondolas</i> by reason of their <i>choppines</i>, and what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
dwarfs they appeare when taken downe from their
wooden scaffolds; of these I saw nearly thirty together,
stalking half as high again as the rest of the
world, for courtezans or the citizens may not weare
<i>choppines</i>, but cover their bodies and faces with a
vaile of a certaine glittering taffeta or lustreè, out of
which they now and then dart a glaunce of their eye,
the whole face being otherwise entirely hid with it;
nor may the common misses take this habit, but go
abroad bare-fac’d. To the corners of these virgin-vailes
hang broad but flat tossells of curious Point de
Venize; the married women go in black vailes. The
nobility weare the same colour, but of fine cloth lin’d
with taffeta in summer, and fur of the bellies of
squirrels in the winter, which all put on at a certaine
day girt with a girdle emboss’d with silver; the vest
not much different from what our Bachelors of Arts
weare in Oxford, and a hood of cloth made like a
sack, cast over their left shoulder, and a round cloth
black cap fring’d with wool which is not so comely;
they also weare their collar open to shew the diamond
buttons of the stock of their shirt. I have never seene
pearles for colour and bignesse comparable to what
the lady’s wear, most of the noble families being very
rich in jewells, especially pearles.</p>

<a id="p_368"></a>THE VENICE OF CARLO GOLDONI<br>
</h3>
<p class="center allsmcap small">A PRINCE AMONG WRITERS OF COMEDY<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I was</span> born at Venice, in the year 1707, in a large and
beautiful house between the bridges of <i>Nomboli</i> and
<i>Donna Onesta</i>, at the corner of the street <i>Cà cent’anni</i>,
in the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas. Julius Goldoni, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
father, was born in the same city; but all his family
were of Modena.</p>

<p>Venice is so extraordinary a city, that it is impossible
to form a correct idea of it without seeing it.
Maps, plans, models, and descriptions, are insufficient;
it must be seen. All other cities bear more or less resemblance
to one another, but Venice resembles
none; and every time I have seen it after a long
absence, it has been a new subject of astonishment
and surprise for me. As I advanced in years, and my
knowledge increased and furnished me with more
numerous objects of comparison, I ever discovered
new singularities and new beauties in it.</p>

<p>But I then saw it as a youth of fifteen, who could
not be supposed to be struck with what in reality was
the most remarkable, and who could only compare
it with the small towns which he had lived in. What
I was most astonished at was the surprising view
which it presents on a first approach. On seeing the
extent of small islands so close together and so admirably
connected by bridges, we imagine we behold
a continent elevated on a plain, and washed on every
side by an immense sea which surrounds it.</p>

<p>This is not the sea, but a very extensive marsh
more or less covered with water, at the mouth of
several ports, with deep canals which admit large and
small vessels into the town and its environs. If you
enter by the quarter of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark through a prodigious
quantity of vessels of every description, ships of war,
merchantmen, frigates, galleys, barks, boats, and
gondolas, you land at the Piazzetta where in one
direction you see the palace and the ducal church,
which announce the magnificence of the republic, and
in another, the place or square of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, surrounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
with porticos from designs by Palladio and
Sansovino.</p>

<p>In going through the streets where haberdashery
goods are sold, you tread on flags of Istrian marble,
carefully roughened by the chisel to prevent them
being slippery. The whole quarter is a perpetual fair
till you arrive at the bridge of a single arch, ninety feet
in breadth, over the great canal, which, from its
elevation, allows the passage of barques and boats
in the highest tides, which offer three different roads
to passengers, and which upholds twenty-four ships
with lodgings, the roofs of which are covered with
lead....</p>

<p>In Italy, their places of public amusement are called
theatres. There are seven in Venice, each bearing the
name of the titular church of its parish. The theatre
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John Chrysostom was then the first in the town,
where the grand operas were represented, where
Metastasio opened his dramatical, and Farinello,
Faustine, and Cozzoni their musical career. At present,
the theatre of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Benedict is highest in rank.
The five other are <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Samuel, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Luke, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Angelo,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cassian, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Moses. Of these seven, two
generally are dedicated to grand operas, two to
comic operas, and three to plays.... There are none
of them which have not had works of mine, and
which have not contributed both to my honour and
profit.</p>

</h3>

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Venice</span>, <i>October 10, 1830</i>.<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Italy</span> at last! and what I have all my life looked
forward to as the greatest possible felicity is now
begun, and I am basking in it. The day has been so
fruitful in enjoyment that I must, now that it is
evening, endeavour to collect my thoughts a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
to write to you, my dear parents, and to thank you
for having bestowed such happiness on me.... I
shall, however, become quite bewildered, if things are
to go on as they have done on this first day, when
every hour brought with it so much never to be forgotten,
that I do not know where to find senses sufficient
to comprehend it all properly. I saw the ‘Assumption,’
then a whole gallery of paintings in the
Manfrini Palace; then a festival in the church where
hangs Titian’s ‘<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’; afterwards <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark’s,
and in the afternoon I had a row on the Adriatic, and
visited the public gardens, where the people lie on
the grass and eat. I then returned to the Piazza of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, where in the twilight there is always an
immense crowd and crush of people; and all this I
was obliged to see to-day, because there is so much
that is novel and interesting to be seen to-morrow.</p>

<p>But I must now relate methodically how I came
hither by water.... In Treviso there was an illumination,
paper lanterns suspended in every part of the
great square, and a large gaudy transparency in the
centre. Some most lovely girls were walking about, in
their long white veils and scarlet petticoats. It was
quite dark when we arrived at Mestre last night, when
we got into a boat, and in a dead calm gently rowed
across to Venice. On our passage thither, where
nothing but water is to be seen, and distant lights, we
saw a small rock which stands in the midst of the sea;
on this a lamp was burning; all the sailors took off
their hats as we passed, and one of them said, this
was the ‘Madonna of Tempests,’ which are often most
dangerous and violent here. We then glided quietly
into the great city, under innumerable bridges, without
sound of post-horns, or rattling of wheels, or tollkeepers;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
the passage now became more thronged,
and numbers of ships lying near; past the theatre,
where gondolas in long rows lie waiting for their
masters, just as our own carriages do at home, then
into the great canal, past the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark, the
Lions, the palace of the Doges, and the Bridge of
Sighs. The obscurity of night only enhanced my
delight on hearing the familiar names and seeing the
dark outlines.</p>

<p>And so I am actually in Venice! Only think: to-day
I have gazed upon the finest pictures in the world,
and have at last personally made the acquaintance of
a very admirable man, whom hitherto I only knew
by name—I allude to a certain Signor Giorgione, a
splendid fellow—and also to Pardenone, who displays
the most noble pictures, and portrays both himself
and many of his simple scholars, in such a devout,
faithful, and pious spirit, that you seem to converse
with and grow fond of him. Who would not have
been confused by all this? But if I am to speak of
Titian, I must do so in a more reverent mood. Till
now, I never knew that he was the felicitous artist I
have this day seen him to be. That he thoroughly
enjoyed life, in all its beauty and fulness, the picture
in Paris proves; but he has fathomed the depths of
human sorrow, as well as the joys of Heaven. His
glorious ‘Entombment,’ and also the ‘Assumption,’
fully evince this. How Mary floats on the cloud, while
an actual <em>air</em> seems to pervade the whole picture;
how you see at a glance her very breathing, her awe,
her devotion, and in short a thousand feelings,—all
words seem poor and commonplace in comparison.
The three heads of angels too, on the right of the
picture, are of the highest order of beauty,—pure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
serene loveliness, so unconscious, so bright and so
seraphic. But no more of this! or I must perforce
become poetical, if I be not so already, and that is a
mood which does not at all suit me. I shall certainly
see that picture every day.... What a man that
Titian was! Everyone must be edified by his works,
as I shall try to be, and I rejoice that I am in Italy.
At this moment the gondoliers are shouting to each
other, and the lights are reflected in the depths of the
waters; one man is playing a guitar, and singing to
it. It is a charming night. Farewell! and think of
me in every happy hour as I do of you.—<span class="smcap">Felix.</span></p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> shall travel hence within a few hours, with the
speed of the post.... We have now got a comfortable
carriage, and two mules, and, thanks to Paolo, have
made a very decent bargain, comprising everything
to Padua. I should say we had delightful fruit for
breakfast, figs, very fine, and peaches, unfortunately
gathered before they were ripe, whose smell was like
what one fancies of the wakening of Paradise flowers....
I came from Padua [to Venice] in a gondola, and
the gondolier, among other things, without any hint
on my part, began talking of Lord Byron. He said he
was a <i lang="it">giovinotto Inglese</i>, with a <i lang="it">nome stravagante</i>, who
lived very luxuriously, and spent great sums of
money. This man, it seems, was one of Lord B.’s
gondoliers.... These gondolas are the most beautiful
and convenient boats in the world. They are finely
carpeted and furnished with black, and painted black.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
The couches on which you lean are extraordinarily
soft, and are so disposed as to be the most comfortable

I called on Lord Byron: he was delighted to see
me. He took me in his gondola across the lagoon to
a long sandy island, which defends Venice from the
Adriatic. When we disembarked, we found his horses
waiting for us, and we rode along the sands of the sea,
talking. Our conversation consisted in histories of his
wounded feelings, and questions as to my affairs, and
great professions of friendship and regard for me.</p>

appreciating the streets and buildings, the aspects and ways of the

<p>‘It is very welcome, for it brings to our notice many delightful
extracts from the works of men and women to whom Edinburgh
has been an inspiration. Mr. Hyatt does full justice to his subject,
with the result that we feel ourselves to be heavily in debt to him....
“The Charm of Edinburgh,” viewed as a whole, is a book
in which there is a holiday for the mind.’—<cite>Literary World.</cite></p>

<p>‘Here is a book which will admirably succeed in emphasizing
to the stranger Edinburgh’s claim to beauty and historical and
literary interest.’—<cite>Athenæum.</cite></p>

so instinct with historical and romantic associations, should have
inspired many pens is but natural; and here we have a goodly
collection of the tributes, both in verse and prose, that have been
paid to the “Queen of the Unconquered North.” Every Scotsman
who is proud of his capital will desire to possess this volume, and
whoever has paid a visit north will find it to be a very pleasant
remembrancer.’—<cite>Birmingham Daily Post.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words had not become
standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple spelling
variations or inconsistent diacriticals and hyphenation in the text. These have been
left unchanged. Jargon, dialect, obsolete and alternative
spellings were left unchanged.</p>

<p>Footnotes were renumbered sequentially and were
moved to the end of the chapter. Obvious printing errors, such as
backwards, upside down, reversed order, or partially printed letters and punctuation, were corrected.
Final stops missing at the end of sentences and abbreviations were
added.</p>

<p>One page of advertisements was moved from the beginning to the end of the book.</p>
